Main activities:
1.Recovering the QTSumm dataset:Python scripts are made to automate URL verification for the QTSumm dataset recovery by implementing a function that performs a fuzzy comparison of the content of the tables. Give statistcs according to the unique `table_id` tables, unique `title` tables and unique tuples(Table,Qestion,Answer).
2.

Achievement(s):
1. Successfully recovered the QTSumm combing both Google Search and Wiki-API methods. 
2. Perform a human verification for the bottom 60 instances with the least overall similarity. Find the optimize threshold overall similarity by the Precision and Recall trending. 
3. Visualize the  overall similarity distribution plot for 


Troubleshooting(s):
1. Test and assign weights for 'title_similarity' and 'table_similarity'.
