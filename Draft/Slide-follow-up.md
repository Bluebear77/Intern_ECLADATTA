### Can you prepare a zip file with all datasets: LOGICNLG, ToTTo, QTSumm with the tables in csv format?

LOGICNLG in csv:https://github.com/wenhuchen/LogicNLG/blob/master/all_csv.zip

ToTTo in jasonl:https://storage.googleapis.com/totto-public/totto_data.zip
 
QTSumm in jason:https://huggingface.co/datasets/yale-nlp/QTSumm/tree/main


### Can you prepare a spreadsheet showing for each dataset (LOGICNLG and ToTTo) the Wikipedia page from which the table comes from?
LOGICNLG does not provide urls. 
https://wenhuchen.github.io/logicnlg.github.io/
<br/>They kind of use the table id as url, but I can't restore the web url based on just this table id.

You can find the ToTTo urls in here:<br/>

### Can you study the overlap between LOGICNLG and ToTTo in terms tables? And in terms of Wikipedia pages from which the tables come from?
