Prompt:

Write a Python script that reads a JSON file and outputs a CSV file containing a table with the following structure:

    The row header should be "TableNum".
    The column headers should be "Column 1", "Column 2", ..., up to the maximum number of columns determined dynamically from the JSON data.

Each cell in the table represents the "typingLabel" for a column in the original tables, identified by the [tableNum, columnIndex] coordinate. If there are multiple "typingLabel" values for a column, always choose the first one.

Structure Details:

The JSON structure is as follows:

    _source >> extractionMetadata >> tables >> tableNum
    _source >> preprocessingMetadata >> technologyResults >> dagobah >> index
    _source >> preprocessingMetadata >> technologyResults >> dagobah >> preprocessed >> primitiveTyping >> columnIndex
    _source >> preprocessingMetadata >> technologyResults >> dagobah >> preprocessed >> primitiveTyping >> typing >> typingLabel

    Match tableNum from tables with index in technologyResults to find the corresponding typing information.

    Ensure that the number of columns in the CSV corresponds to the highest columnIndex found in the primitiveTyping data for each table.

    Create a log file recording any tables for which no primitiveTyping data was found.

Example of the CSV structure:

sql

| TableNum | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 0        | PERSON   | UNKNOWN  | UNKNOWN  | UNKNOWN  |

Output Requirements:

    The CSV file should be saved as output.csv.
    The log file should be saved as log.txt with entries such as "For file [file_name], the table [tableNum] no primitiveTyping data was found."

Please write and execute the Python script.

***

extract_typing_labels: Extracts typing labels and generates a CSV file. Ensures "UNKNOWN" values are not converted to NaN.
extract_key_column: Extracts the primary key position directly from the JSON file.
extract_typing_label_from_csv: Extracts typing labels from the generated CSV files for a specific table, ensuring no conversion to NaN and removing trailing empty values.
update_table_with_key_and_types: Updates the processed JSON data with the key column and column types.
process_file: Main function to process each file, generate the CSV, log missing data, and update the JSON output.
Loop through the files: Processes files from 1 to 100.
