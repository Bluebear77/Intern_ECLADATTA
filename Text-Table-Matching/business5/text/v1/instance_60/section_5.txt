In the mid-1960s the French government set up a group under Sollac's director general, Louis Dherse, to look into building a second new French steel mill.
The government pushed Sollac into building the plant at [[Fos-sur-Mer]] in the Rhone's Mediterranean delta.{{sfn|James|2006|p=311}}
Sollac would have preferred a site near Le Havre, since it would have been closer to large markets, but the government's regional development plans took priority.{{sfn|Daley|1996|p=103}}
Solmer (Societé Lorraine et Méridionale de Laminage Continu) was formed in November 1970 as a Sollac subsidiary to build and operate the new plant.
Sollac was in turn a subsidiary of Wendel-Sidélor.{{sfn|Mény|Wright|Rhodes|1987|p=509}}
At the same time, Usinor decided to increase the capacity of its Dunkirk plant to 8 million tons per year.
Taken with the 4 million tons from Fos-sur-Mer, the two companies would add almost 8 million tons or about 45% of total French output between 1968 and 1973.{{sfn|Godelier|2008|p=122}}

By 1971 Wendel-Sidélor was the largest steel producer in France, owning Sacilor, the majority of Sollac, and many smaller facilities.
However, its productivity was 40% below that of [[Usinor]].{{sfn|Daley|1996|p=104}}
Great hopes were pinned in the Fos-sur-Mer project, but in 1971 Wendel-Sidélor did not have enough revenue to finance the project without assistance.
In May 1972 Jacques Ferry of the CSSF helped the government persuade the head of Usinor to help bail out the project, despite his very poor relationship with the head of Wendel-Sidélor.
In October 1972 it was agreed that Ferry would head Solmer, which would be jointly controlled by Usinor and Wendel-Sidélor.{{sfn|Mény|Wright|Rhodes|1987|p=509}}
Solmer was 47.5% owned by Wendel-Sidélor, 47.5% by Usinor and 5% by [[Thyssen AG|Thyssen]].{{sfn|James|2006|p=311}}
