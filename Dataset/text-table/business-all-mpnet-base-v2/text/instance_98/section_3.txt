Title: Architecture

Value:
equallogic systems use   iscsi   via either   gigabit ethernet   or   10 gigabit ethernet   controllers  the currently  june 2014  sold systems with 1 gbits connections are the ps4100  ps6100 and ps6200 while the comparable systems with 10 gbits ethernet connections are ps4110  ps6110 and ps6210  there have been a number of previous generations  and long the software is updated older systems they can work with the newer models  within each series there are several options allowing for different types and sizes of   hard disk drive   or   solidstate drive   equallogic options combine both in the same chassis and automatically migrate the most frequently accessed data to the ssds  all ps series systems  except the    blade sanpsm4110   blade chassis system  are   19inch rack   systems in a 2   rack unit   form factor or a 4 ru chassis for some of the ps61x0 models and the ps65x0 dense models  equallogic arrays can be combined with up to 16 arrays per group  groups can mix different members  including multiple hardware generations  well different raid types  in a group  by combining multiple arrays per group  very large storage groups can be created with maximum capacity in one group of over 15   petabytepb    arrays can be segmented into pools  and from pools  volumes  volumes are exposed a san network  and used by virtual machine hosts or other computers
