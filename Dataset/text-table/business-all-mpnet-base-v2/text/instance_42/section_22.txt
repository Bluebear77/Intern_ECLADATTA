Title: Ocean liners

Value:
the attempts by fijenoord to enter the market for   ocean liner   were of national significance  dutch shipping companies had insufficient confidence in the capabilities of the indigenous industry and therefore used to order their ocean going steamers in great britain  in turn this meant that the dutch shipyards did not acquire any experience in building these ships    sfnlintsen 1993p95   to break this deadlock the nsm built a big ship at fijenoord speculation   the idea was that if it would not get sold  the nsm would use it for a line to the dutch east indies  27 april 1881 the nederland of 98 was launched  she sailed to baltimore in september 1881  and with an efficient coal consumption of only 086 kghph   sfnlintsen 1993p96   she proved a complete success  in may 1882 the nederland was sold to the nederlandschamerikaansche stoomvaartmaatschappij  nasm   who renamed her leerdam   the nasm used to name her ships for places ending dam   the nasm is now named   holland america line    and continues this practice  the fact that fijenoord got an order for the second ocean liner  the zaandam  meant that the gamble to construct the nederland paid off  with the nederland still the slipway  the nederlandschamerikaansche stoomvaartmaatschappij ordered the comparable zaandam without actual proof of the mechanical capabilities of the nederland  the zaandam was laid down in early may 1881   ref    cite news urlhttps  resolverkbnlresolve  urnmmkb04000163471  mpeg21  p002  work  maasbode titlebinnenland  date3 may 1881    ref  before the trial run of the nederland in august  ref    cite news urlhttps  resolverkbnlresolve  urnddd010101747  mpeg21  p002  work  algemeen handelsblad titlestoomvaartberichten date14 august 1881    ref  she was launched in may 1882  and in october 1882 she arrived in new york  however successful these two ships were  the nsm lost money them  because her costs were too high    sfnlintsen 1993p96   the order for a third ocean liner  the edam  came about by an accident  in august 1881 a steamship edam had been launched for the nasm in dumbarton  1 january 1882 this ship left rotterdam for newyork  and suffered so much damage in a storm  that she had to be saved by the napier of captain anderson  the edam reentered service  but 21 september 1882 she was hit midships by ss lepanto and sank in 20 minutes  ref    cite news urlhttps  resolverkbnlresolve  urnddd011068112  mpeg21  p004  work  standaard titlebinnenland date27 september 1882    ref  in october 1882 the nasm then contracted with fijenoord for a new edam of comparable dimensions  but made of steel  ref    cite news urlhttps  resolverkbnlresolve  urnddd011068383  mpeg21  p002  work  standaard titlegemengd nieuws date31 august 1883    ref  the new edam was launched 30 august 1883
