Title: NSM becomes Fijenoord

Value:
for some time the shipping lines of the nsm had not operated to satisfaction  in 1895 the nsm therefore finally decided to end the shipping activities  the old   batavier line   from rotterdam to london was sold to wm  h  m√ºller    sfnwest  van1954p8   it meant that the official name of the company  nederlandsche stoomboot maatschappij  became rather odd  in 1895 the name was changed to nv maatschappij voor scheeps werktuigbouw fijenoord  which better reflected the activities of the company  it was the name under which it would merge with nv dok werf maatschappij to become wiltonfijenoord
