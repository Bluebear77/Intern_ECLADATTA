Title: Formation

Value:
After [[World War II]] (1939–45) the United States wanted to ensure that the French steel industry could compete effectively with the Ruhr.{{sfn|Kipping|1994|p=232}}
[[Usinor]] (Union Sidérurgique du Nord de la France) was formed in 1948 by a merger of [[Denain-Anzin]], founded in 1849 and Nord-Est (Forges et Aciéries du Nord-Est).{{sfn|Goddard|Narotzky|2015|loc=PT149}}
The main reason for the merger was to implement a continuous rolling mill to reduce costs and satisfy the expected growing market for automobiles and consumer goods. The company used technology from United Engineering and Westinghouse Electric International.{{sfn|Barjot|2002|p=34}}
In 1948 it was accepted that a second strip mill should be set up, also using American equipment.{{sfn|Kipping|1994|p=232}}

In 1948 [[Léon Daum]] promoted the creation of Sollac as a joint-venture flat steel manufacturer.{{sfn|J.M.|1966}}
Most of the funding came from the state.
François Bloch-Lainé justified this in 1948 on the basis that Sollac would be in the state's interest.
The Société Lorraine de Laminage Continu (Sollac) was established in December 1948.{{sfn|James|2006|p=305}}
It was created under a cooperative model to build a wide-strip rolling mill in [[Florange]], as well as a Thomas and Martin mill and two cold mills.
The founding companies retained their autonomy.{{sfn|Freyssenet|1979|p=24}}
Each company supplied its share of cast iron or steel, which Sollac turned into sheet metal, charging cost price.{{sfn|Freyssenet|1979|p=24}}
The founders included:{{sfn|Freyssenet|1979|p=24}}{{sfn|James|2006|p=305}}

The Sollac project was submitted by France to the Organisation of European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) in April 1949, which had representatives of all the Marshall Plan countries.
When the Belgians refused to approve the project, the Marshall Plan's Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) recommended that the project be funded anyway.{{sfn|Kipping|1994|p=233}}
A large part of the [[Marshall Plan]] counterpart funds of 1949–51 were used by Sollac and [[Usinor]].{{sfn|James|2006|p=305}}
Sollac became the largest single project funded by the Marshall Plan, with $49.4 million of direct funds and $83.7 million of counterpart funds.
It was hoped by the Americans that with two strip mills a French monopoly was less likely to emerge.{{sfn|Kipping|1994|p=233}}
