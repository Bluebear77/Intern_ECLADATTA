Sollac (Société Lorraine de Laminage Continu)  was a French steel company formed in December 1948 as a cooperative to produce steel rolls in Lorraine from steel provided by several other companies. There were various changes of ownership during the years that followed.
In 1970 the company, under pressure from the French government, began to develop a large new continuous strip mill in the south of France.
The French steel industry soon went into crisis, with excess capacity and declining demands from automobile manufacturers and the construction industry.
Sollac became a subsidiary of [[Usinor]] in 1987, responsible for all flat products.
In 2002 Usinor became part of [[Arcelor]], which in turn was merged into [[ArcelorMittal]] in 2006.
