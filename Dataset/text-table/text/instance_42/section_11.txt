Title: Steam ships on the Rhine

Value:
the significance of fijenoord for the netherlands was in its construction of heavy tugboats  after the independence of belgium there was a possibility that belgium would eliminate the dutch transit trade to germany by constructing a railway from antwerp to cologne    sfnwest  van1954p5   such a railway would be realized from antwerp to liège  aachen and cologne in 1843  at a time that the harbor of antwerp had far better accessibility than that of rotterdam  however  the heavy tugboat tugged river barges upstream and proved more than a match for rail transport  especially for bulk cargo    sfnwest  van1954p5   the average speed of the rhine is about 3 knots  but that in narrow places it can be double that amount  at the time a steam vessel that attained 8 knots was considered to be fast  early steam vessels the rhine were successful if they could costeffectively steam upstream by themselves while carrying enough passengers and freight to cover the cost  in this respect the higher   powertoweight ratio   of a high pressure engine  or even better  a compound engine contributes to economic feasibility  the same applies even more when pulling other ships against the current long stretches  in 1830 the hercules and stad keulen would tow ships with a load of up to 10000   quintal   up the rhine far   emmerich am rheinemmerich    where the faster current begins  and would then continue with only their own cargo of 25003000 quintals  ref nameah24031830   in 1836 the dutch government wanted to promote the export of colonial goods to germany by improving transport the middle rhine  it advanced 260000 guilders to construct a steam tugboat meant to serve the rhine between lobith and cologne  this tugboat was named laurens koster  the service started in october 1838  but was terminated by the government in early 1841  the nsm might not have had anything to do with the line  but fijenoord probably built the laurens koster  the government got the 260000 back by subtracting 200000 guilders from the price of the batavia  cf  below   and by accepting the steam tugboat laurens koster payment for the remaining 60000  she would serve a training vessel for the navy  ref namens04111846   in 1829 the nsm had operated the stad keulen  a ship that was previously the english james watt  and had been lengthened at fijenoord  in 1835 roentgen told his shareholders that the stad keulen had been equipped with a compound engine    sfnlintsen 1994p229   in 1835 fijenoord was constructing the steam vessel stad dusseldorp for a line between arnhem and   düsseldorf     ref    cite news urlhttps  resolverkbnlresolve  urnddd010150232  mpeg21  p004  work  arnhemsche courant titlemengelwerk date24 december 1835    ref
