the nsm had ordered its first ships locally  it ordered their engines first from england  and then from cockerill based designs and advice from roentgen  the idea for the corporation was that cockerill would have the monopoly steam engines for ships in the netherlands  and would only deliver to the nsm  a positive explanation for this monopoly was that the nsm wanted to prevent its knowledge from leaking away via cockerill  but of course it could not hold  within a few years the nsm and cockerill got into conflict about this  already in august 1825 nsm reserved money for a complete repair shop for steam engines  which was also designed to form the nucleus of a factory that could build complete steam engines  in october 1825 nsm then started negotiations to rent the terrain at fijenoord from the municipality of rotterdam    sfnl√∂hnis1916p136   this repair shop became known etablissement fijenoord   sfnlintsen 1993p75
