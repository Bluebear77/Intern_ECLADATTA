the orders for iron warships continued in the 1850s  in this respect it is remarkable that fijenoord continued to build many paddlewheel driven vessels deep into the 1870s  at first the paddle vessels were gunboatsized  and then the ability to sail close to shore explains the paddlewheel propulsion  another explanation could be that fijenoord had only built paddle engines when the medusa was started in 1852    sfnlintsen 1993p79   but in light of the above this can only hold for big engines  the baffling aspect of these paddlewheel driven vessels was that after the dutch industry had proven its ability to build engines for big screw warships  and the dutch navy in the netherlands had switched to screw propulsion  the dutch east indies navy began to order bigger paddlewheel driven vessels  in general conservatism  is a bad explanation for seemingly erratic behavior  the fact that screw ships required more drydock capacity could be a better explanation  25 september 1851 the paddle vessel celebes was  re  launched in surabaya  she was of the same dimensions the borneo  but did have a keel  ref    cite news urlhttps  resolverkbnlresolve  urnddd010073121  mpeg21  p002  work  algemeen handelsblad  titlenederlandsche koloniën date18 december 1851    ref  in 1853 the paddle gunboat admiraal van kinsbergen  built by fijenoord  arrived in java board the maria magdalena  ref    cite news urlhttps  resolverkbnlresolve  urnddd010482800  mpeg21  p001  work  javabode  titlebatavia date9 march 1853    ref  20 july 1853 she was  re  launched in surabaya  ref    cite news urlhttps  resolverkbnlresolve  urnddd011059881  mpeg21  p001  work  oostpost  titlesoerabaya  den 20sten julij date9 march 1853    ref  the next gunboat built by fijenoord was the madura  3 november 1857 the madura was relaunched in surabaya  with a note that she was of the same type the kinsbergen  ref    cite news urlhttps  resolverkbnlresolve  urnddd011060174  mpeg21  p004  work  oostpost  titlesoerabaya  den 9den november 1857 date9 november 1857    ref  the 18471848 onrust was surprised and destroyed by rebels in december 1859  in november 1862 a new onrust was launched in surabaya  ref    cite news urlhttps  resolverkbnlresolve  urnddd010389735  mpeg21  p001  work  rotterdamsche courant  titlekoloniën date27 december 1862    ref  the surprising orders for big steampaddle vessels started in the mid1860s  in may 1866 four steam paddle ships of 200 hp and 1000 displacement primarily meant for transport duties  were ordered for the department of the colonies  two at van vlissingen dudok van heel  and two at fijenoord  at fijenoord the sumatra was launched first 12 october 1866  the timor was launched 13 february 1867  in 1874 these would be followed by two 1500 displacement ships  another ship  the 1874 celebes was remarkable for being bigger than these ships at the waterline  but having less than half their displacement because of her draught of only 18 there were also orders for steam engines from the navy  eg  for hnlms medusa  also for hnlms bali  launched in kinderdijk in 1856  and for   hnlms wassenaar  1856  hnlms wassenaar    furthermore for   hnlms_groningen_  1857  hnlms groningen   and   hnlms djambi  1860  hnlms djambi    also for the bronbeek  launched in surabaya january 1861  the monitors adder and haai were some of the first armored ships built at fijenoord
