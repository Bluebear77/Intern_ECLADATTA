Title: Technical description

Value:
the hcsdma interface operates a similar premise   cellular phone    with handoffs between hcsdma cells repeatedly providing the user with a seamless wireless   internet access   even when moving at the speed of a car or train  the standard proposed benefits   ip roaming  handoff  at more than 1 mbits   new mac and phy with ip and adaptive antennas  optimized for full mobility up to vehicular speeds of 250 kmh  operates in licensed bands  below 35 ghz   uses packet architecture  low latency some technical details were   bandwidths of 5  10  and 20 mhz   peak data rates of 80 mbits   spectral efficiency above 1 bitsechz using   mimomultiple inputmultiple output technology    mimo    layered frequency hopping allocates ofdm carriers to near  middle  and faraway handsets  improving snr  works best for siso handsets    supports lowbit rates efficiently  carrying up to 100 phone calls per mhz   hybrid arq with up to 6 transmissions and several choices for interleaving   basic slot period of 913 microseconds carrying 8 ofdm symbols   one of the first standards to support both tdm  fl  rl  and separatefrequency  fl  rl  deployments  the protocol   specifies base station and client device rf characteristics  including output power levels  transmit frequencies and timing error    pulse shaping    inband and outof band spurious emissions  receiver sensitivity and selectivity   defines associated frame structures for the various burst types including standard uplink and downlink traffic  paging and broadcast burst types   specifies the modulation  forward error correction  interleaving and scrambling for various burst types   describes the various logical channels  broadcast  paging  random access  configuration and traffic channels  and their roles in establishing communication over the radio link  and  specifies procedures for error recovery and retry  the protocol also supports   network layerlayer 3    l3  mechanisms for creating and controlling logical connections  sessions  between client device and base including registration  stream start  power control  handover  link adaptation  and stream closure  well l3 mechanisms for client device authentication and   secure transmission   the data links  currently deployed iburst systems allow connectivity up to 2 mbits for each subscriber equipment  apparently there will be future firmware upgrade possibilities to increase these speeds up to 5 mbits  consistent with hcsdma protocol    citation needed dateaugust 2011
