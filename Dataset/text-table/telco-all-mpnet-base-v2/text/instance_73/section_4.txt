Title: Security

Value:
although the range of nfc is limited to a few centimeters  standard plain nfc is not protected against   eavesdropping   and can be vulnerable to data modifications  applications may use higherlayer   cryptographic protocol   to establish a secure channel  the rf signal for the wireless data transfer can be picked up with antennas  the distance from which an attacker is able to eavesdrop the rf signal depends multiple parameters  but is typically less than 10 meters  ref    cite web  first  gerhard p  last  hancke  url  http  wwwrfidblogorgukhanckerfidsec08eavesdroppingpdf  title  eavesdropping attacks highfrequency rfid tokens  series  4th workshop rfid security  rfidsec08   date  july 2008  accessdate  20160105  archivedate  20160304  archiveurl  https  webarchiveorgweb20160304073920http  wwwrfidblogorgukhanckerfidsec08eavesdroppingpdf  urlstatus  live    ref  also  eavesdropping is highly affected by the communication mode  a passive device that does nt generate its own rf field is much harder to eavesdrop than an active device  an attacker can typically eavesdrop within 10 of an active device and 1 for passive devices  ref name  security in nfc     cite web first1ernst last1haselsteiner first2klemens last2breitfu√ü urlhttp  rfidsec2013iaiktugrazatrfidsec06programpapers002  20  20security  20in  20nfcpdf titlesecurity in near field communication  nfc   accessdate20200223 archivedate20200805 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20200805030847http  rfidsec2013iaiktugrazatrfidsec06programpapers002  20  20security  20in  20nfcpdf urlstatuslive    ref  because nfc devices usually include   isoiec 14443   protocols    relay attack   are feasible  ref name  note1     cite webfirstgerhard plasthanckeurlhttp  wwwrfidblogorgukresearchhtml  relaytitlea practical relay attack isoiec 14443 proximity cardsdatefebruary 2005archiveurlhttps  archivetoday20120912090338http  wwwrfidblogorgukresearchhtml  23relay  relayarchivedate20120912accessdate20080713urlstatuslive    ref   ref name  timo kasper al    timo kasper al  2007  ref    page neededdatejanuary 2015   for this attack the adversary forwards the request of the reader to the victim and relays its answer to the reader in real time  pretending to be the owner of the victim smart card  this is similar to a   maninthemiddle attack     ref name  note1    one   monolibnfc   code example demonstrates a relay attack using two stock commercial nfc devices  this attack can be implemented using only two nfcenabled mobile phones  ref    cite journalfirstlishoylastfrancisurlhttp  eprintiacrorg2011618titlepractical relay attack contactless transactions by using nfc mobile phonesjournalcryptology eprint archiveyear2011accessdate20120103archivedate20120509archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20120509145214http  eprintiacrorg2011618urlstatuslive    ref
