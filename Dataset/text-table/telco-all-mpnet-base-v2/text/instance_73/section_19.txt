Title: Bluetooth comparison

Value:
nfc and bluetooth are both relatively shortrange communication technologies available   mobile phones    nfc operates at slower speeds than bluetooth and has a much shorter range  but consumes far less power and does nt require pairing  ref name  nfcorg     cite webtitlenear field communication versus bluetoothurlhttp  wwwnearfieldcommunicationorgbluetoothhtmlaccessdate28 november 2012archivedate20 november 2012archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20121120055952http  wwwnearfieldcommunicationorgbluetoothhtmlurlstatuslive    ref  nfc sets up more quickly than standard bluetooth  but has a lower transfer rate than   bluetooth low energy    with nfc  instead of performing manual configurations to identify devices  the connection between two nfc devices is automatically established in less than 1 second  the maximum data transfer rate of nfc  424 kbits  is slower than that of bluetooth v21  21 mbits   nfc maximum working distance of less than 20 cm reduces the likelihood of unwanted interception  making it particularly suitable for crowded areas that complicate correlating a signal with its transmitting physical device  and by extension  its user    ref    cite weburlhttp  bitkuasedutwjihmsp2015vol6jihmsp201506007pdftitlenfc based equipment management inventory systemaccessdate20190422archivedate20190422archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20190422210651http  bitkuasedutwjihmsp2015vol6jihmsp201506007pdfurlstatuslive    ref  nfc is compatible with existing passive rfid  1356 mhz isoiec 180003  infrastructures  it requires comparatively low power  similar to the bluetooth v40 lowenergy protocol  however  when nfc works with an unpowered device  eg  a phone that may be turned off  a contactless smart credit card  a smart poster   the nfc power consumption is greater than that of bluetooth v40 low energy  since illuminating the passive tag needs extra power  ref name  nfcorg
