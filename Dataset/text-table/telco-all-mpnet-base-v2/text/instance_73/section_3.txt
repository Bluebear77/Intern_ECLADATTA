nfc is a set of shortrange wireless technologies  typically requiring a separation of 10 cm or less  nfc operates at 1356   mhz     isoiec 180003   air interface and at rates ranging from 106 kbits to 424 kbits  nfc always involves an initiator and a target  the initiator actively generates an   radio frequencyrf   field that can power a passive target  this enables nfc targets to take very simple form factors such unpowered tags  stickers  key fobs  or cards  nfc peertopeer communication is possible  provided both devices are powered  ref name  popscinfc    nfc tags contain data and are typically readonly  but may be writable  they can be customencoded by their manufacturers or use nfc forum specifications  the tags can securely store personal data such debit and credit card information  loyalty program data  pins and networking contacts  among other information  the nfc forum defines four types of tags that provide different communication speeds and capabilities in terms of configurability  memory  security    data retention   and write endurance  with   proximity card   technology  nfc uses   inductive coupling   between two nearby   electromagnetic coilloop antennas   effectively forming an aircore   transformer    because the distances involved are tiny compared to the   wavelength   of   electromagnetic radiation    radio waves  of that frequency  about 22 metres   the interaction is described   near and far fieldnear field    an alternating   magnetic field   is the main coupling factor and almost no power is radiated in the form of   radio wave    which are electromagnetic waves  also involving an oscillating   electric field     that minimises interference between such devices and any radio communications at the same frequency or with other nfc devices much beyond its intended range  nfc operates within the globally available and unlicensed   radio frequency     ism band   of 1356 mhz  most of the rf energy is concentrated in the 7 khz bandwidth allocated for that band  but the emission   bandwidth  signal processing  spectral width   can be wide 18 mhz  ref name  patauner2007     cite conference  authorpatauner    author2witschnig

about 20 cm  but practically speaking  working distances never exceed 10 cm   note that because the pickup antenna may be quenched in an   eddy current   by nearby metallic surfaces  the tags may require a minimum separation from such surfaces  ref    cite journaltitleinvestigation of using radio frequency identification  rfid  system for gear tooth crack detectionyear2014citeseerx  101110114228    ref  the isoiec 18092 standard supports data rates of 106  212 or 424   kbits    the communication takes place between an active  initiator  device and a target device which may either be   passive  the initiator device provides a carrier field and the target device  acting a   transponder    communicates by modulating the incident field  in this mode  the target device may draw its operating power from the initiatorprovided magnetic field   active  both initiator and target device communicate by alternately generating their own fields  a device stops transmitting in order to receive data from the other  this mode requires that both devices include power supplies  nfc employs two different   coding theorycoding   to transfer data  if an active device transfers data at 106 kbits  a modified   miller coding   with 100    modulation   is used  in all other cases   manchester coding   is used with a modulation ratio of 10   every active nfc device can work in one or more of three modes   nfc card emulation  enables nfcenabled devices such smartphones to act like smart cards  allowing users to perform transactions such payment or ticketing  see   host card emulation    nfc readerwriter  enables nfcenabled devices to read information stored inexpensive nfc tags embedded in labels or smart posters   nfc peertopeer  enables two nfcenabled devices to communicate with each other to exchange information in an   ad hoc networkad hoc   fashion  nfc tags are passive data stores which can be read  and under some circumstances written to  by an nfc device  they typically contain data    of2015lcy   between 96 and 8192 bytes  and are readonly in normal use  but may be rewritable  applications include secure personal data storage  eg    debit carddebit   or   credit card   information    loyalty program   data    personal identification number    pins   contacts   nfc tags can be customencoded by their manufacturers or use the industry specifications
