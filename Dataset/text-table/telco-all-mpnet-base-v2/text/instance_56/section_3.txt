mobile phones receive and send radio signals with any number of   cell site   base stations fitted with   microwave     radioantenna   these sites are usually mounted a tower  pole or building  located throughout populated areas  then connected to a cabled communication network and switching system  the phones have a lowpower   transceiver   that transmits voice and data to the nearest cell sites  normally not more than 8 to 13 km  approximately 5 to 8 miles  away  in areas of low   coverage  telecommunication  coverage    a   cellular repeater   may be used  which uses a longdistance highgain   dish antenna   or   yagi antenna   to communicate with a cell tower far outside of normal range  and a repeater to rebroadcast a small shortrange local antenna that allows any cellphone within a few meters to function properly  when the mobile phone or data device is turned  it registers with the   mobile switching centermobile telephone exchange    or switch  with its unique identifiers  and can then be alerted by the mobile switch when there is an incoming telephone call  the handset constantly listens for the strongest signal being received from the surrounding base stations  and is able to   mobility managementswitch seamlessly   between sites  the user moves around the network  the    handoff    are performed to allow the device to switch sites without interrupting the call    cell site   have relatively lowpower  often only one or two watts  radio transmitters which broadcast their presence and relay communications between the mobile handsets and the switch  the switch in turn connects the call to another subscriber of the same   wireless service provider   or to the   pstnpublic telephone network    which includes the networks of other wireless carriers  many of these sites are camouflaged to blend with existing environments  particularly in scenic areas  the dialogue between the handset and the cell site is a stream of digital data that includes digitised audio  except for the first generation analog networks   the technology that achieves this depends the system which the   mobile phone operator   has adopted  the technologies are grouped by generation  the firstgeneration systems started in 1979 with japan  are all analog and include amps and nmt  secondgeneration systems  started in 1991 in finland  are all digital and include   gsm      cdma   and   digital ampstdma    the gsm standard is a european initiative expressed at the   european conference of postal and telecommunications administrationscept     conférence européenne postes telecommunications   european postal and telecommunications conference   the francogerman r  cooperation demonstrated the technical feasibility  and in 1987 a memorandum of understanding was signed between 13 european countries who agreed to launch a commercial service by 1991  the first version of the gsm  2g  standard had 6000 pages  the ieeerse awarded to   thomas haug   and   philippe dupuis  engineer  philippe dupuis   the 2018   ieeerse james clerk maxwell medaljames clerk maxwell medal   for their contributions to the first digital mobile telephone standard

for gsm started at the cept working group gsm  group special mobile  in 1982 under the umbrella of cept  in 1988    etsi   was established and all cept standardization activities were transferred to

coverage  telecommunication  coverage    for example  in a road tunnel   when the signal is reestablished  the phone sends out a reconnect  signal to the nearest celltower  identifying itself and signalling that it is again ready to transmit  with the proper equipment  it is possible to intercept the reconnect signal and encode the data it contains into a blank  phonein all respects  the blank  is then an exact duplicate of the real phone and any calls made the clone  will be charged to the original account  this problem was widespread with the first generation analogue technology  however the modern digital standards such   gsm   greatly improve security and make cloning hard to achieve  in an effort to limit the potential harm from having a transmitter close to the user body  the first fixedmobile cellular phones that had a separate transmitter  vehiclemounted antenna  and handset  known car phones and bag phones  were limited to a maximum 3 watts   effective radiated power    modern handheld cellphones which must have the transmission antenna held inches from the user skull are limited to a maximum transmission power of 06 watts erp  regardless of the potential biological effects  the reduced transmission range of modern handheld phones limits their usefulness in rural locations compared to carbag phones  and handhelds require that cell towers are spaced much closer together to compensate for their lack of transmission power
