a call switching infrastructure that tracks users they move through a network and passes their calls from one site to another without dropping the connection  in 1956  the   mtd  mobile network  mta   system was launched in sweden  the early efforts to develop mobile telephony faced two significant challenges  allowing a great number of callers to use the comparatively few available frequencies simultaneously and allowing users to seamlessly move from one area to another without having their calls dropped  both problems were solved by bell labs employee amos joel who  in 1970 applied for a patent for a mobile communications system  ref  patent no  3663762  issued may 16  1972  ref  however  a business consulting firm calculated the entire us  market for mobile telephones at 100000 units and the entire worldwide market at no more than 200000 units based the ready availability of pay telephones and the high cost of constructing cell towers  a consequence  bell labs concluded that the invention was  of little or no consequence   leading it not to attempt to commercialize the invention  the invention earned joel induction into the national inventors hall of fame in 2008  ref    list
