Title: Forward broadcast channels

Value:
every bts dedicates a significant amount of output power to a pilot channel  which is an unmodulated pn sequence  in other words  spread with walsh code 0   each bts sector in the network is assigned a pn offset in steps of 64 chips  there is no data carried the forward pilot  with its strong   autocorrelation   function  the forward pilot allows mobiles to determine system timing and distinguish different btss for   handoff    when a mobile is  searching   it is attempting to find pilot signals the network by tuning to particular radio frequencies and performing a crosscorrelation across all possible pn phases  a strong correlation peak result indicates the proximity of a bts  other forward channels  selected by their walsh code  carry data from the network to the mobiles  data consists of network signaling and user traffic  generally  data to be transmitted is divided into frames of bits  a frame of bits is passed through a convolutional encoder  adding forward error correction redundancy  generating a frame of symbols  these symbols are then spread with the walsh and pn sequences and transmitted  btss transmit a sync channel spread with walsh code 32  the sync channel frame is  math  frac  80   3   math  ms long  and its frame boundary is aligned to the pilot  the sync channel continually transmits a single message  the sync channel message  which has a length and content dependent the p_rev  the message is transmitted 32 bits per frame  encoded to 128 symbols  yielding a rate of 1200 bits  the sync channel message contains information about the network  including the pn offset used by the bts sector  once a mobile has found a strong pilot channel  it listens to the sync channel and decodes a sync channel message to develop a highly accurate synchronization to system time  at this point the mobile knows whether it is roaming  and that it is  in service   btss transmit at least one  and many seven  paging channels starting with walsh code 1  the paging channel frame time is 20 ms  and is time aligned to the is95 system  ie  gps  2second rollover  there are two possible rates used the paging channel  4800 bits or 9600 bits  both rates are encoded to 19200 symbols per second  the paging channel contains signaling messages transmitted from the network to all idle mobiles  a set of messages communicate detailed network overhead to the mobiles  circulating this information while the paging channel is free  the paging channel also carries higherpriority messages dedicated to setting up calls to and from the mobiles  when a mobile is idle  it is mostly listening to a paging channel  once a mobile has parsed all the network overhead information  it registers with the network  then optionally enters slottedmode  both of these processes are described in more detail below
