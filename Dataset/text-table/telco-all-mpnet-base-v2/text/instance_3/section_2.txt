Title: Protocol revisions

Value:
cdmaone technical history is reflective of both its birth a qualcomm internal project  and the world of thenunproven competing digital cellular standards under which it was developed  the term is95 generically applies to the earlier set of protocol revisions  namely p_rev one through five  p_rev1 was developed under an   american national standards instituteansi   standards process with documentation reference jstd008  jstd008  published in 1995  was only defined for the thennew north american pcs band  band class 1  1900 mhz   the term is95 properly refers to p_rev1  developed under the   telecommunications industry association    tia  standards process  for the north american cellular band  band class 0  800 mhz  under roughly the same time frame  is95 offered interoperation  including handoff  with the analog cellular network  for digital operation  is95 and jstd008 have most technical details in common  the immature style and structure of both documents are highly reflective of the  standardizing  of qualcomm internal project  p_rev2 is termed interim standard 95a  is95a   is95a was developed for band class 0 only  in incremental improvement over is95 in the tia standards process  p_rev3 is termed technical services bulletin 74  tsb74   tsb74 was the next incremental improvement over is95a in the tia standards process  p_rev4 is termed interim standard 95b  is95b  phase i  and p_rev5 is termed interim standard 95b  is95b  phase ii  the is95b standards track provided for a merging of the tia and ansi standards tracks under the tia  and was the first document that provided for interoperation of is95 mobile handsets in both band classes  dualband operation   p_rev4 was by far the most popular variant of is95  with p_rev5 only seeing minimal uptake in south korea  p_rev6 and beyond fall under the   cdma2000   umbrella  besides technical improvements  the is2000 documents are much more mature in terms of layout and content  they also provide backwardscompatibility to is95
