Title: Physical layer

Value:
is95 defines the transmission of signals in both the forward  networktomobile  and reverse  mobiletonetwork  directions  in the forward direction  radio signals are transmitted by base stations  bts   every bts is synchronized with a   gps   receiver so transmissions are tightly controlled in time  all forward transmissions are   qpsk   with a chip rate of 1228800 per second  each signal is spread with a   walsh code   of length 64 and a   pseudorandom noise   code    pn sequencespn code    of length 2  sup  15  sup   yielding a pn rollover period of  math  frac  80   3   math  ms  for the reverse direction  radio signals are transmitted by the mobile  reverse link transmissions are   oqpsk   in order to operate in the optimal range of the mobile power amplifier  like the forward link  the chip rate is 1228800 per second and signals are spread with   walsh codes   and the   pseudorandom noise   code  which is also known a short code
