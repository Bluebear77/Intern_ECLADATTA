Title: Capacity

Value:
is95 and its use of cdma techniques  like any other communications system  have their throughput limited according to   shannon theorem    accordingly  capacity improves with snr and bandwidth  is95 has a fixed bandwidth  but fares well in the digital world because it takes active steps to improve snr  with cdma  signals that are not correlated with the channel of interest  such other pn offsets from adjacent cellular base stations  appear noise  and signals carried other walsh codes  that are properly time aligned  are essentially removed in the despreading process  the variablerate nature of traffic channels provide lowerrate frames to be transmitted at lower power causing less noise for other signals still to be correctly received  these factors provide an inherently lower noise level than other cellular technologies allowing the is95 network to squeeze more users into the same radio spectrum  active  slow  power control is also used the forward traffic channels  where during a call  the mobile sends signaling messages to the network indicating the quality of the signal  the network will control the transmitted power of the traffic channel to keep the signal quality just good enough  thereby keeping the noise level seen by all other users to a minimum  the receiver also uses the techniques of the   rake receiver   to improve snr well perform   soft handoff
