Title: Forward traffic channels

Value:
the walsh space not dedicated to broadcast channels the bts sector is available for traffic channels  these channels carry the individual voice and data calls supported by is95  like the paging channel  traffic channels have a frame time of 20ms  since voice and user data are intermittent  the traffic channels support variablerate operation  every 20 ms frame may be transmitted at a different rate  determined by the service in use  voice or data   p_rev1 and p_rev2 supported rate set 1  providing a rate of 1200  2400  4800  or 9600 bits  p_rev3 and beyond also provided rate set 2  yielding rates of 1800  3600  7200  or 14400 bits  for voice calls  the traffic channel carries frames of vocoder data  a number of different vocoders are defined under is95  the earlier of which were limited to rate set 1  and were responsible for some user complaints of poor voice quality  more sophisticated vocoders  taking advantage of modern dsps and rate set 2  remedied the voice quality situation and are still in wide use in 2005  the mobile receiving a variablerate traffic frame does not know the rate at which the frame was transmitted  typically  the frame is decoded at each possible rate  and using the quality metrics of the   viterbi decoder    the correct result is chosen  traffic channels may also carry circuitswitch data calls in is95  the variablerate traffic frames are generated using the is95 radio link protocol  rlp   rlp provides a mechanism to improve the performance of the wireless link for data  where voice calls might tolerate the dropping of occasional 20 ms frames  a data call would have unacceptable performance without rlp  under is95b p_rev5  it was possible for a user to use up to seven supplemental  code   traffic  channels simultaneously to increase the throughput of a data call  very few mobiles or networks ever provided this feature  which could in theory offer 115200 bits to a user
