Title: Rationale for E-UTRA

Value:
although   umts    with   hsdpa   and   hsupa   and their   evolved hspaevolution    deliver high data transfer rates  wireless data usage is expected to continue increasing significantly over the next few years due to the increased offering and demand of services and content onthemove and the continued reduction of costs for the final user  this increase is expected to require not only faster networks and radio interfaces but also higher costefficiency than what is possible by the evolution of the current standards  thus the 3gpp consortium set the requirements for a new radio interface  eutran  and core network evolution    system architecture evolutionsystem architecture evolution sae    that would fulfill this need  these improvements in performance allow   wireless   operators to offer   quadruple play   services   snd   voice  highspeed interactive applications including large data transfer and   featurerich     iptv   with full mobility  starting with the 3gpp release 8  eutra is designed to provide a single evolution path for the   gsm      edge      umts      high speed packet accesshspa      cdma2000      evdo   and   tdscdmatdscdma   radio interfaces  providing increases in data speeds  and spectral efficiency  and allowing the provision of more functionality
