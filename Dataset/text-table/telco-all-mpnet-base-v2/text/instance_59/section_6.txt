mimo can be subdivided into three main categories    precoding      spatial multiplexing    sm   and   diversity codingdiversity coding      precoding   is multistream   beamforming    in the narrowest definition  in more general terms  it is considered to be all spatial processing that occurs at the transmitter  in  singlestream  beamforming  the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate phase and gain weighting such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver input  the benefits of beamforming are to increase the received signal gain  by making signals emitted from different antennas add up constructively  and to reduce the multipath fading effect  in   lineofsight propagation    beamforming results in a welldefined directional pattern  however  conventional beams are not a good analogy in cellular networks  which are mainly characterized by   multipath propagation    when the receiver has multiple antennas  the transmit beamforming can not simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of the receive antennas  and precoding with multiple streams is often beneficial  precoding requires knowledge of   channel state information    csi  at the transmitter and the receiver    spatial multiplexing   requires mimo antenna configuration  in spatial multiplexing   ref    cite bookauthor1rakhesh singh kshetrimayum titlefundamentals of mimo wireless communicationspublishercambridge university press year2017author1linkrakhesh singh kshetrimayum    ref  a highrate signal is split into multiple lowerrate streams and each stream is transmitted from a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel  if these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate csi  it can separate these streams into  almost  parallel channels  spatial multiplexing is a very powerful technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signaltonoise ratios  snr   the maximum number of spatial streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver  spatial multiplexing can be used without csi at the transmitter  but can be combined with   precoding   if csi is available  spatial multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers  known   spacedivision multiple access   or   multiuser mimo    in which case csi is required at the transmitter  ref    cite journalauthor1d  gesbert author2m  kountouris author3r  w heath  jr  author4cb chae author5t  s√§lzer nameliststyleamp titleshifting the mimo paradigm  from single user to multiuser communicationsjournal ieee signal processing magazinevolume 24issue 5pages 3646dateoct 2007doi101109msp2007904815bibcode2007ispm  24  36gs2cid8771158    ref  the scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability    diversity coding   techniques are used when there is no   channel state informationchannel knowledge   at the transmitter  in diversity methods  a single stream  unlike multiple streams in spatial multiplexing  is transmitted  but the signal is coded using techniques called   spacetime coding    the signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with full or near orthogonal coding  diversity coding exploits the independent fading in the multiple antenna links to enhance signal diversity  because there is no channel knowledge  there is no beamforming or   array gain   from diversity coding  diversity coding can be combined with spatial multiplexing when some channel knowledge is available at the receiver
