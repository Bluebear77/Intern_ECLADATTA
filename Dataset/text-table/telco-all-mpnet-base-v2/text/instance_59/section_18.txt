Title: Sampling theory in MIMO systems

Value:
an important question which attracts the attention of engineers and mathematicians is how to use the multioutput signals at the receiver to recover the multiinput signals at the transmitter  in shang  sun and zhou  2007   sufficient and necessary conditions are established to guarantee the complete recovery of the multiinput signals  ref    cite journalauthor1z  shang  w sun author2x  zhou nameliststyleamp title vector sampling expansions in shift invariant subspaces journal journal of mathematical analysis and applicationspages898919volume325issue2datejanuary 2007doi101016jjmaa200602033bibcode2007jmaa  325  898s doiaccessfree    ref
