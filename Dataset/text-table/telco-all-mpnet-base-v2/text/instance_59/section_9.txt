  mainmultiuser mimo   recently  results of research multiuser mimo technology have been emerging  while full multiuser mimo  or network mimo  can have a higher potential  practically  the research  partial  multiuser mimo  or multiuser and multiantenna mimo  technology is more active  ref    cite bookauthor1b  kumbhani  r kshetrimayum titlemimo wireless communications over generalized fading

specification by a number of companies  including samsung  intel  qualcomm  ericsson  ti  huawei  philips  nokia  and freescale  for these and other firms active in the mobile hardware market  mumimo is more feasible for lowcomplexity cell phones with a small number of reception antennas  whereas singleuser sumimo higher peruser throughput is better suited to more complex user devices with more antennas    enhanced multiuser mimo  1  employs advanced decoding techniques  2  employs advanced precoding techniques   sdma represents either   spacedivision multiple access   or superdivision multiple access where super emphasises that orthogonal division such frequency and timedivision is not used but nonorthogonal approaches such superposition coding are used     cooperative mimo    comimo    uses multiple neighboring base stations to jointly transmitreceive data tofrom users  a result  neighboring base stations do nt cause intercell interference in the conventional mimo systems     macrodiversity   mimo   a form of space diversity scheme which uses multiple transmit or receive base stations for communicating coherently with single or multiple users which are possibly distributed in the coverage area  in the same time and frequency resource  ref namekarakayali    cite journaldoi101109mwc20061678166 pages 5661title advances in smart antennas  network coordination

apart in contrast to traditional microdiversity mimo schemes such singleuser mimo  in a multiuser macrodiversity mimo scenario  users may also be far apart  therefore  every constituent link in the virtual mimo link has distinct average link   signaltonoise ratiosnr    this difference is mainly due to the different longterm channel impairments such path loss and shadow fading which are experienced by different links    macrodiversity mimo schemes pose unprecedented theoretical and practical challenges  among many theoretical challenges  perhaps the most fundamental challenge is to understand how the different average link snrs affect the overall system capacity and individual user performance in fading environments  ref namebasnayaka    cite
