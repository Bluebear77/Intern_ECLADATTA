Title: MIMO detection

Value:
a fundamental problem in mimo communication is estimating the transmit vector   math  mathbf  x   math   given the received vector   math  mathbf    math   this can be posed a statistical detection problem  and addressed using a variety of techniques including zeroforcing   ref    cite journal last1yang first1shaoshi last2hanzo first2lajos titlefifty years of mimo detection  the road to largescale mimos journalieee communications surveys  tutorials datefourth quarter 2015 volume17 issue4 pages19411988 doi101109comst20152475242arxiv150705138 s2cid834673    ref  successive interference cancellation aka    vblast      maximum likelihood estimation   and recently    neural network   mimo detection  ref    cite journal last1samuel first1n  last2diskin first2t  last3wiesel first3a  titlelearning to detect journalieee transactions signal processing datemay 2019 volume67 issue10 pages25542564 doi101109tsp20192899805arxiv180507631 bibcode2019itsp  672554s s2cid29157140    ref  such techniques commonly assume that the channel matrix  math  mathbf  h   math  is known at the receiver  in practice  in communication systems  the transmitter sends a   pilot signal   and the receiver learns the state of the channel  ie   math  mathbf  h   math   from the received signal  math   math  and the   pilot signal    math  x  math   recently  there are works mimo detection using   deep learning   tools which have shown to work better than other methods such zeroforcing  ref    cite book last1sholev first1omer last2permuter first2haim h  last3bendror first3eilam last4liang first4wenliang title2020 ieee wireless communications and networking conference  wcnc  chapterneural network mimo detection for coded wireless communication with impairments datemay 2020 pages18 doi101109wcnc4566320209120517isbn9781728131061 s2cid219978098    ref
