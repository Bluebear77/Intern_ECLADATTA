Title: Testing

Value:
mimo signal testing focuses first the transmitterreceiver system  the random phases of the subcarrier signals can produce instantaneous power levels that cause the amplifier to compress  momentarily causing distortion and ultimately symbol errors  signals with a high    peaktoaverage ratio    can cause amplifiers to compress unpredictably during transmission  ofdm signals are very dynamic and compression problems can be hard to detect because of their noiselike nature  ref  stefan schindler  heinz mellein   assessing a mimo channel    dead linkdatemay 2017 botinternetarchivebot fixattemptedyes    rohde  schwarz  pg  11  ref  knowing the quality of the signal channel is also critical  a   radio channel emulatorchannel emulator   can simulate how a device performs at the cell edge  can add noise or can simulate what the channel looks like at speed  to fully qualify the performance of a receiver  a calibrated transmitter  such a   signal generator  vector signal generatorsvector signal generator    vsg   and channel emulator can be used to test the receiver under a variety of different conditions  conversely  the transmitter performance under a number of different conditions can be verified using a channel emulator and a calibrated receiver  such a   vector signal analyzer    vsa   understanding the channel allows for manipulation of the phase and amplitude of each transmitter in order to form a beam  to correctly form a beam  the transmitter needs to understand the characteristics of the channel  this process is called   channel sounding   or   channel estimation    a known signal is sent to the mobile device that enables it to build a picture of the channel environment  the mobile device sends back the channel characteristics to the transmitter  the transmitter can then apply the correct phase and amplitude adjustments to form a beam directed at the mobile device  this is called a closedloop mimo system  for   beamforming    it is required to adjust the phases and amplitude of each transmitter  in a beamformer optimized for spatial diversity or spatial multiplexing  each antenna element simultaneously transmits a weighted combination of two data symbols  ref    cite weburlhttp  rfmwemkeysightcomwirelesshelpfilesn5106a59898973enpdftitlemimo channel modeling and emulation test challengeswebsitekeysight    ref
