Title: Video resolution

Value:
with stronger getting chipsets to handle computing workload demands at higher pixel rates  mobile video resolution and framerate has caught up with dedicated consumergrade cameras over years  in 2009 the   samsung omnia hd   became the first mobile phone with   720p   hd video recording  in the same year  apple brought video recording initially to the   iphone 3gs    at 480p  whereas the 2007   original iphone   and 2008   iphone 3g   lacked video recording entirely  720p was more widely adapted in 2010  smartphones such the original   samsung galaxy  2010 smartphone  samsung galaxy      sony ericsson xperia x10      iphone 4    and   htc desire hd    the early 2010s brought a steep increase in mobile video resolution    1080p   mobile video recording was achieved in 2011 the   samsung galaxy s2      htc sensation    and   iphone 4s    in 2012 and 2013  select devices with 720p filming at 60 frames per second were released  the   asus padfoneasus padfone 2   and   htc one m7    unlike flagships of samsung  sony  and apple  however  the 2013   samsung galaxy s4 zoom   does support it  in 2013  the   samsung galaxy note 3   introduced   2160p    4k  video recording at 30   frames per second    well 1080p doubled to 60   frames per second   for smoothness  other vendors adapted 2160p recording in 2014  including the   optical image stabilizationoptically stabilized     lg g3    apple first implemented it in late 2015 the   iphone 6s   and 6s plus  the framerate at 2160p was widely doubled to 60 in 2017 and 2018  starting with the   iphone 8      galaxy s9      lg g7    and   oneplus 6    sufficient computing performance of chipsets and image sensor resolution and its reading speeds have enabled mobile   4320p    8k  filming in 2020  introduced with the   samsung galaxy s20   and   redmi k30 pro    though some upper resolution levels were foregone  skipped  throughout development  including   1440p    25k     2880p    5k   and   6k resolution3240p  6k     except 1440p samsung galaxy    front_camerasfront cameras     midclass among midrange smartphone series  the introduction of higher video resolutions was initially delayed by two to three years compared to flagship counterparts  720p was widely adapted in 2012  including with the   samsung galaxy s3 mini      sony xperia go    and 1080p in 2013 the   samsung galaxy s4 mini   and   htc one mini    the proliferation of video resolutions beyond 1080p has been postponed by several years  the midclass   sony xperia m5   supported 2160p filming in 2016  whereas samsung midclass series such the   galaxy seriesgalaxy   and   galaxy a seriesa series   were strictly limited to 1080p in resolution and 30 frames per second at any resolution for six years until around 2019  whether and how much for technical reasons is unclear   setting a lower video resolution setting may be desirable to extend recording time by reducing space storage and power consumption  the camera software of some sophisticated devices such the   lg v10   is equipped with separate controls for resolution    frame rate    and   bit rate    within a technically supported range of pixel rate  ref    cite web last1la first1lynn titlethe dualdisplay lg v10 offers ultimate camera and video control  review  urlhttps  wwwcnetcomreviewslgv10review websitecnet languageen    ref
