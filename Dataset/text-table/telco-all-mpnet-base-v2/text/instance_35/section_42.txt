Title: Space constraints

Value:
typically smartphones have at least one main rearfacing camera and a lowerresolution frontfacing camera for    selfie    and   video chat    owing to the limited depth available in smartphones for   image sensor   and   lensoptics    rearfacing cameras are often housed in a  bump  that thicker than the rest of the phone  since increasingly thin mobile phones have more abundant horizontal space than the depth that is necessary and used in dedicated cameras for better lenses  there additionally a trend for phone manufacturers to include multiple cameras  with each optimized for a different purpose    telephoto lenstelephoto      wideangle lenswide angle    etc   viewed from back  rear cameras are commonly located at the top center or top left corner  a cornered location benefits by not requiring other hardware to be packed around the camera module while increasing   ergonomy    the lens is less likely to be covered when held horizontally  modern advanced smartphones have cameras with   image stabilization  optical image stabilizationoptical image stabilisation    ois   larger sensors  bright lenses  and even optical zoom plus   raw image formatraw   images    highdynamicrange imaginghdr       bokeh   mode  with multi lenses and multishot   night mode cameranight mode   are now also familiar  ref    cite web titletop 16 best camera phones for photography 2019 urlhttps  wwwephotozinecomarticletop16bestcameraphonesforphotography201923050 dateapril 4  2019 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20190512034618https  wwwephotozinecomarticletop16bestcameraphonesforphotography201923050 archivedatemay 12  2019    ref  many new smartphone camera features are being enabled via   computational photography     digital image processingimage processing   and multiple specialized lenses rather than larger sensors and lenses  due to the constrained space available inside phones that are being made slim possible
