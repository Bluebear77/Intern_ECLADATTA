Title: Slow motion video

Value:
a distinction between different camera software is the method used to store high frame rate video footage  with more recent phones   efnfor example  samsung starting with the   galaxy s6     retaining both the image sensor original output frame rate and audio  while earlier phones do not record audio and stretch the video so it can be played back slowly at default speed  while the stretched encoding method used earlier phones enables slow motion playback   media player softwarevideo player software   that lacks manual playback speed control  typically found older devices  if the aim were to achieve a slow motion effect  the realtime method used by more recent phones offers greater versatility for video editing  where slowed down portions of the footage can be freely selected by the user  and exported into a separate video  a rudimentary video editing software for this purpose is usually preinstalled  the video can optionally be played back at normal  realtime  speed  acting usual video   development the earliest smartphone known to feature a slow motion mode is the 2009   samsung i8000 omnia ii    which can record at qvga  320240  at 120 fps    frames per second     slow motion was not available the 2010   galaxy s1    2011   galaxy s2    2011   galaxy note 1    and 2012   galaxy s3   flagships  in early 2012  the   htc one x   allowed 768432 pixel slow motion filming at an undocumented frame rate  the output footage has been measured a third of realtime speed  ref    cite web titlehtc one x review  extra special urlhttps  wwwgsmarenacomhtc_one_xreview747p6php websitegsmarenacom date20120412    ref  in late 2012  the   galaxy note 2   brought back slow motion  with d1  720  480  at 120 fps  in early 2013  the   galaxy s4   and   htc one m7   recorded at that frame rate with 800  450  followed by the   note 3   and   iphone 5s   with 720p  1280  720  in late 2013  the latter of which retaines audio and original sensor frame rate  with all later iphones  in early 2014  the   sony xperia z2   and   htc one m8   adapted this resolution well  in late 2014  the   iphone 6   doubled the frame rate to 240 fps  and in late 2015  the   iphone 6s   added support for 1080p  1920  1080  at 120 frames per second  in early 2015  the   galaxy s6   became the first samsung mobile phone to retain the sensor framerate and audio  and in early 2016  the   galaxy s7   became the first samsung mobile phone with 240 fps recording  also at 720p  in early 2015  the mt6795 chipset by   mediatek   promised 1080p  480 fps video recording  the project status remains indefinite  ref    cite web titlemediatek shows off 480fps super slowmotion 1080p video recording the mt6795 urlhttps  wwwneowinnetnewsmediatekshowsoff480fpssuperslowmotion1080pvideorecordingonthemt6795 websiteneowin languageen date20150217    ref  since early 2017  starting with the   sony xperia xz    smartphones have been released with a slow motion mode that unsustainably records at framerates multiple times high  by temporarily storing frames the image sensor internal burst memory  such a recording endures few realtime seconds at most  in late 2017  the   iphone 8   brought 1080p at 240 fps  well 2160p at 60 fps  followed by the galaxy s9 in early 2018  in mid2018  the   oneplus 6   brought 720p at 480 fps  sustainable for one minute  in early 2021  the   oneplus 9 pro   became the first phone with 2160p at 120 fps
