Title: Protocols supported

Value:
gprs supports the following protocols     internet protocol    ip   in practice  builtin   mobile browser   use   ipv4   before   ipv6   is widespread     pointtopoint protocol    ppp  is typically not supported by   mobile phone operator   but if a cellular phone is used a   modem   for a connected computer  ppp may be used to tunnel ip to the phone  this allows an ip address to be dynamically assigned  using   internet protocol control protocolipcp   rather than   dynamic host configuration protocoldhcp    to the mobile equipment     x25   connections are typically used for applications like wireless payment terminals  although it has been removed from the standard  x25 can still be supported over ppp  or even over ip  but this requires either a networkbased   router  computing  router   to perform encapsulation or software built into the enddeviceterminal  eg  user equipment  ue   when   internet protocol suitetcpip   is used  each phone can have one or more   ip address   allocated  gprs will store and forward the ip packets to the phone even during   handover    the tcp restores any packets lost  eg  due to a radio noise induced pause
