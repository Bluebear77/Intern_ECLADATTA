Title: Multiple access schemes

Value:
the   multiple access method   used in gsm with gprs are based   frequencydivision duplex    fdd  and tdma  during a session  a user is assigned to one pair of uplink and downlink frequency channels  this is combined with time domain   statistical multiplexing   which makes it possible for several users to share the same frequency channel  the packets have constant length  corresponding to a gsm time slot  the downlink uses   firstcome firstserved   packet scheduling  while the uplink uses a scheme very similar to   reservation aloha    raloha   this means that   slotted aloha    saloha  is used for reservation inquiries during a contention phase  and then the actual data is transferred using   dynamic tdma   with firstcome firstserved
