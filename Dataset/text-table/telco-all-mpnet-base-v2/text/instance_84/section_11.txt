Title: Channel encoding

Value:
the channel encoding process in gprs consists of two steps  first  a cyclic code is used to add parity bits  which are also referred to the block check sequence  followed by coding with a possibly punctured   convolutional code     ref name  ts45001     cite web urlhttp  www3gpporgftpspecshtmlinfo45001htm title3ggp ts45001  technical specification group gsmedge radio access network  physical layer the radio path  general description author3rd generation partnership project version1210 datenovember 2014 accessdate20151205    ref  the coding schemes cs1 to cs4 specify the number of parity bits generated by the cyclic code and the puncturing rate of the convolutional code  ref name  ts45001    in coding schemes cs1 through cs3  the convolutional code is of rate 12  ie  each input bit is converted into two coded bits  ref name  ts45001    in coding schemes cs2 and cs3  the output of the convolutional code is   punctured codepunctured   to achieve the desired code rate  ref name  ts45001    in coding scheme cs4  no convolutional coding is applied  ref name  ts45001    the following table summarises the options    notelist   the least robust  but fastest  coding scheme  cs4  is available near a   base transceiver stationbase transceiver station    bts   while the most robust coding scheme  cs1  is used when the mobile station  ms  is further away from a bts  using the cs4 it is possible to achieve a user speed of 200 kbits per time slot  however  using this scheme the cell coverage is 25  of normal  cs1 can achieve a user speed of only 80 kbits per time slot  but has 98  of normal coverage  newer network equipment can adapt the transfer speed automatically depending the mobile location  in addition to gprs  there are two other gsm technologies which deliver data services    circuit switched datacircuitswitched data    csd  and   highspeed circuitswitched data    hscsd   in contrast to the shared nature of gprs  these instead establish a dedicated circuit  usually billed per minute   some applications such   video calling   may prefer hscsd  especially when there is a continuous flow of data between the endpoints  the following table summarises some possible configurations of gprs and circuit switched data services
