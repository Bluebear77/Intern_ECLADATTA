Title: Usability

Value:
the maximum speed of a gprs connection offered in 2003 was similar to a   modem   connection in an analog wire telephone network  about 3240 kbits  depending the phone used    latency  engineering  latency   is very high  roundtrip time  rtt  is typically about 600700 ms and often reaches 1s  gprs is typically prioritized lower than speech  and thus the quality of connection varies greatly  devices with latencyrtt improvements  via  for example  the extended ul tbf mode feature  are generally available  also  network upgrades of features are available with certain operators  with these enhancements the active roundtrip time can be reduced  resulting in significant increase in applicationlevel throughput speeds
