Title: Multislot Class

Value:
the multislot class determines the speed of data transfer available in the   uplink   and   downlink   directions  it is a value between 1 and 45 which the network uses to allocate radio channels in the uplink and downlink direction  multislot class with values greater than 31 are referred to high multislot classes  a multislot allocation is represented  for example  52  the first number is the number of downlink timeslots and the second is the number of uplink timeslots allocated for use by the mobile station  a commonly used value is class 10 for many gprsegprs mobiles which uses a maximum of 4 timeslots in downlink direction and 2 timeslots in uplink direction  however simultaneously a maximum number of 5 simultaneous timeslots can be used in both uplink and downlink  the network will automatically configure for either 32 or 41 operation depending the nature of data transfer  some high end mobiles  usually also supporting   umts    also support gprs   edge   multislot class 32  according to   3gpp   ts 45002  release 12   table b1   ref name  ts45002     cite web urlhttp  www3gpporgftpspecshtmlinfo45002htm title3ggp ts45002  technical specification group gsmedge radio access network  multiplexing and multiple access the radio path  release 12  version1240 author3rd generation partnership project datemarch 2015 accessdate20151205    ref  mobile stations of this class support 5 timeslots in downlink and 3 timeslots in uplink with a maximum number of 6 simultaneously used timeslots  if data traffic is concentrated in downlink direction the network will configure the connection for 51 operation  when more data is transferred in the uplink the network can at any time change the constellation to 42 or 33  under the best reception conditions  ie  when the best edge   modulation and coding scheme   can be used  5 timeslots can carry a bandwidth of 5  592 kbits  296 kbits  in uplink direction  3 timeslots can carry a bandwidth of 3  592 kbits  1776 kbits  ref    cite web urlhttp  mobilesocietytypepadcommobile_life200704gprs_and_edge_mhtml titlegprs and edge multislot classes accessdate20100621 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20101127153600http  mobilesocietytypepadcommobile_life200704gprs_and_edge_mhtml archivedate20101127 urlstatusdead    ref
