Title: Connectionless and connection-oriented modes

Value:
packet switching may be classified into   connectionless communicationconnectionless   packet switching  also known   datagram   switching  and   connectionoriented communicationconnectionoriented   packet switching  also known   virtual circuit   switching  examples of connectionless systems are   ethernet      internet protocol    ip   and the   user datagram protocol    udp   connectionoriented systems include   x25      frame relay      multiprotocol label switching    mpls   and the   transmission control protocol    tcp   in connectionless mode each packet is labeled with a destination address  source address  and port numbers  it may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet  this information eliminates the need for a preestablished path to help the packet find its way to its destination  but means that more information is needed in the packet header  which is therefore larger  the packets are routed individually  sometimes taking different paths resulting in   outoforder delivery    at the destination  the original message may be reassembled in the correct order  based the packet sequence numbers  thus a   virtual circuit   carrying a   byte stream   is provided to the application by a   transport layer   protocol  although the network only provides a connectionless   network layer   service  connectionoriented transmission requires a setup phase to establish the parameters of communication before any packet is transferred  the   signaling  telecommunications  signaling   protocols used for setup allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters  acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated  the packets transferred may include a connection identifier rather than address information and the packet header can be smaller  it only needs to contain this code and any information  such length  timestamp  or sequence number  which is different for different packets  in this case  address information is only transferred to each node during the connection setup phase  when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes  when a connection identifier is used  routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection identifier in a table    citation neededdateapril 2021   connectionoriented transport layer protocols such tcp provide a connectionoriented service by using an underlying connectionless network  in this case  the   endtoend principle   dictates that the end nodes  not the network itself  are responsible for the connectionoriented behavior
