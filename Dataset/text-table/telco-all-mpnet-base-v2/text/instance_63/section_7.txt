Title: Packet switching in networks

Value:
packet switching is used to optimize the use of the   channel capacity   available in digital telecommunication networks  such computer networks  and minimize the transmission   network latencylatency    the time it takes for data to pass across the network   and to increase   robustness  computer science  robustness   of communication  packet switching is used in the   internet   and most   local area network   the internet is implemented by the   internet protocol suite   using a variety of   link layer   technologies  for example    ethernet   and   frame relay   are common  newer   mobile phone   technologies  eg    gsm      lte  telecommunication  lte    also use packet switching  packet switching is associated with connectionless networking because  in these systems  no connection agreement needs to be established between communicating parties prior to exchanging data    x25   is a notable use of packet switching in that  despite being based packet switching methods  it provides   virtual circuit   to the user  these virtual circuits carry variablelength packets  in 1978  x25 provided the first international and commercial packet switching network  the   international packet switched service    ipss     asynchronous transfer mode    atm  also is a virtual circuit technology  which uses fixedlength   cell relay   connection oriented packet switching  technologies such   multiprotocol label switching    mpls  and the   resource reservation protocol    rsvp  create virtual circuits top of datagram networks  mpls and its predecessors  well atm  have been called  fast packet  technologies  mpls  indeed  has been called  atm without cells    ref    cite weburlhttp  wwwcertificationzonecomcisconewsletterslinterview_081203htmltitleinterview with the author  of an mplsbased vpn article  archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20070929150800http  wwwcertificationzonecomcisconewsletterslinterview_081203htmlarchivedate20070929firstglastpildush    ref  virtual circuits are especially useful in building robust failover mechanisms and allocating bandwidth for delaysensitive applications
