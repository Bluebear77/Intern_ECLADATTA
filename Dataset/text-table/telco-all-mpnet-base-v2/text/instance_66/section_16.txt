Title: Media access control layer

Value:
the wimax mac uses a   scheduling algorithm   for which the subscriber station needs to compete only once for initial entry into the network  after network entry is allowed  the subscriber station is allocated an access slot by the base station  the time slot can enlarge and contract  but remains assigned to the subscriber station  which means that other subscribers can not use it  in addition to being stable under overload and oversubscription  the scheduling algorithm can also be more   bandwidth  computing  bandwidth   efficient  the scheduling algorithm also allows the base station to control qos parameters by balancing the timeslot assignments among the application needs of the subscriber station
