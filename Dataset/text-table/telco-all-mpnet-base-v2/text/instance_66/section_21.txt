Title: Inherent limitations

Value:
wimax can not deliver 70   bit ratembits   over   convert50kmmiabbron    like all wireless technologies  wimax can operate at higher bitrates or over longer distances but not both  operating at the maximum range of   convert50kmmiabbron   increases   bit error ratiobit error rate   and thus results in a much lower bitrate  conversely  reducing the range  to under 1 km  allows a device to operate at higher bitrates  a citywide deployment of wimax in   perth      australia   demonstrated that customers at the celledge with an indoor   customerpremises equipment    cpe  typically obtain speeds of around 14 mbits  with users closer to the cell site obtaining speeds of up to 30 mbits    citation neededdateaugust 2010   like all wireless systems  available bandwidth is shared between users in a given radio sector  so performance could deteriorate in the case of many active users in a single sector  however  with adequate capacity planning and the use of wimax qos  a minimum guaranteed throughput for each subscriber can be put in place  in practice  most users will have a range of 48 mbits services and additional radio cards will be added to the base station to increase the number of users that may be served required
