Title: Comparison with other mobile Internet standards

Value:
  maincomparison of wireless data standards   the following table only shows peak rates which are potentially very misleading  in addition  the comparisons listed are not normalized by physical channel size  ie  spectrum used to achieve the listed peak rates   this obfuscates spectral efficiency and net throughput capabilities of the different wireless technologies listed below    comparison of mobile internet standards
