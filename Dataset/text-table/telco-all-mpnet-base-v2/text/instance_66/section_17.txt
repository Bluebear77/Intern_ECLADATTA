Value:
a standard intended to satisfy needs of nextgeneration data networks    4g     wimax is distinguished by its dynamic burst algorithm modulation adaptive to the physical environment the rf signal travels through  modulation is chosen to be more spectrally efficient  more bits per   orthogonal frequencydivision multiplexingofdm      orthogonal frequencydivision multiple accesssofdma   symbol   that is  when the bursts have a high   field strengthsignal strength   and a high   carrier to noise ratiocarrier to noise   plus interference ratio  cinr   they can be more easily decoded using   digital signal processing    dsp   in contrast  operating in less favorable environments for rf communication  the system automatically steps down to a more robust mode  burst profile  which means fewer bits per ofdmsofdma symbol  with the advantage that power per bit is higher and therefore simpler accurate signal processing can be performed  burst profiles are used inverse  algorithmically dynamic  to low signal attenuation  meaning throughput between clients and the base station is determined largely by distance  maximum distance is achieved by the use of the most robust burst setting  that is  the profile with the largest mac frame allocation tradeoff requiring more symbols  a larger portion of the mac frame  to be allocated in transmitting a given amount of data than if the client were closer to the base station  the client mac frame and their individual burst profiles are defined well the specific time allocation  however  even if this is done automatically then the practical deployment should avoid high interference and multipath environments  the reason for which is obviously that too much interference causes the network to function poorly and can also misrepresent the capability of the network  the system is complex to deploy it is necessary to track not only the signal strength and cinr  in systems like   gsm    but also how the available frequencies will be dynamically assigned  resulting in dynamic changes to the available bandwidth   this could lead to cluttered frequencies with slow response times or lost frames  a result  the system has to be initially designed in consensus with the base station product team to accurately project frequency use  interference  and general product functionality  the asiapacific region has surpassed the north american region in terms of 4g broadband wireless subscribers  there were around 17 million prewimax and wimax customers in asia  29  of the overall market  compared to 14 million in the us and canada  ref    cite weburlhttp  wwwtelegeographycomcuarticlephp  article_id33959 titleasia takes the lead in the 4g market websitetelegeographycom dateaugust 5  2010 accessdateoctober 30  2012    ref
