Title: Comparison

Value:
comparisons and confusion between wimax and   wifi   are frequent  because both are related to wireless connectivity and internet access  ref  wimax vs  wifi   webarchiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20101123215518http  wwwcircleidcomposts92208_wimax_vs_wifi date20101123    circleidcom  20080220   retrieved 20130918  ref   wimax is a long range system  covering many kilometres  that uses licensed or unlicensed spectrum to deliver connection to a network  in most cases the internet   wifi uses the 24 ghz and 5 ghz radio frequency bands to provide access to a local network   wifi is far more popular in enduser devices   wifi runs the   media access controlmedia access control     carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidancecsmaca   protocol  which is connectionless and contention based  whereas wimax runs a connectionoriented mac   wimax and wifi have quite different qos mechanisms    wimax uses a qos mechanism based connections between the base station and the user device  each connection is based specific scheduling algorithms    wifi uses   contention  telecommunications  contention   access  all subscriber stations that wish to pass data through a   wireless access point    ap  are competing for the ap attention a random interrupt basis  this can cause subscriber stations distant from the ap to be repeatedly interrupted by closer stations  greatly reducing their throughput   both   ieee 80211    which includes wifi  and   ieee 80216    which includes wimax  define   peertopeerpeertopeer  p2p    and   wireless ad hoc network    where an end user communicates to users or servers another   local area networklocal area network    lan  using its   wireless access pointaccess point   or   base station    however  80211 supports also direct ad hoc or peer to peer networking between end user devices without an access point while 80216 end user devices must be in range of the base station  although wifi and wimax are designed for different situations  they are complementary  wimax network operators typically provide a wimax subscriber unit that connects to the metropolitan wimax network and provides wifi connectivity within the home or business for computers and smartphones  this enables the user to place the wimax subscriber unit in the best reception area  such a window  and have date access throughout their property
