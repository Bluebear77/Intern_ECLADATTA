Title: Echo cancellation

Value:
fullduplex audio systems like telephones can create echo  which is distracting to users and impedes the performance of modems  echo occurs when the sound originating from the far end comes out of the speaker at the near end and reenters the microphone   efnthis feedback path may be acoustic  through the air  or it may be mechanically coupled  for example in a telephone handset    there and is then sent back to the far end  the sound then reappears at the original source end but delayed    echo cancellation   is a signalprocessing operation that subtracts the farend signal from the microphone signal before it is sent back over the network  echo cancellation is important technology allowing   modem   to achieve good fullduplex performance  the   itut v32v32      itut v34v34      itut v56v56    and   itut v90v90   modem standards require echo cancellation  ref    cite booklast1 greensteinfirst1shane last2 stangofirst2victor titlestandards and public policyurlhttps  booksgooglecombooks  id3hmkhwumaz8c  pgpa129year2006publishercambridge university pressisbn9781139460750pages129132    ref  echo cancelers are available both software and hardware implementations  they can be independent components in a communications system or integrated into the communication system   central processing unit
