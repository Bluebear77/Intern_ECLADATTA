Title: Overview

Value:
the first hspa specifications supported increased peak data rates of up to 14 mbits in the downlink and 576 mbits in the uplink  they also reduced latency and provided up to five times more system capacity in the downlink and up to twice much system capacity in the uplink compared with original wcdma protocol  high speed downlink packet access  hsdpa     file  cellular network standards and generation timelinesvgthumbcellular network standards and generation timeline   high speed downlink packet access  hsdpa  is an enhanced   3g    thirdgeneration    mobile telephonymobile     communications protocol   in the highspeed packet access  hspa  family  hsdpa is also known 35g and 3g  it allows networks based the   umtsuniversal mobile telecommunications system    umts  to have higher data speeds and capacity  hsdpa also decreases   latency  engineering  latency    and therefore the   roundtrip time   for applications  hsdpa was introduced in   3gpp   release 5  it was accompanied by an improvement to the uplink that provided a new bearer of 384 kbits  the previous maximum bearer was 128 kbits     evolved high speed packet access    hspa   introduced in 3gpp release 7  further increased data rates by adding 64qam modulation    mimo    and   evolved high speed packet access  dualcarrier hsdpa  dchsdpa  dualcarrier hsdpa   operation  under 3gpp release 11  even higher speeds of up to 3375 mbits were possible  ref name  gsmworld     cite web  urlhttp  wwwgsmacomaboutusgsmtechnologyhspa  titlehspa  workabout us    ref  the first phase of hsdpa was specified in 3gpp release 5  this phase introduced new basic functions and was aimed to achieve peak data rates of 140 mbits with significantly reduced latency  the improvement in speed and latency reduced the cost per bit and enhanced support for highperformance packet data applications  hsdpa is based shared channel transmission  and its key features are shared channel and multicode transmission    higherorder modulation    short   transmission time interval    tti   fast link adaptation and scheduling  and fast   hybrid automatic repeat request    harq   additional new features include the high speed downlink shared channels  hsdsch     phaseshift keying  quadrature phaseshift keying  qpsk  quadrature phaseshift keying    16   quadrature amplitude modulation    and the high speed medium access protocol  machs  in base stations  the upgrade to hsdpa is often just a software update for wcdma networks  in hsdpa  voice calls are usually prioritized over data transfer
