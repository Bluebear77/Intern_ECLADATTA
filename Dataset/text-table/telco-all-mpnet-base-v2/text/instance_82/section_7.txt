hsupa adds a new transport channel to wcdma  called the enhanced dedicated channel  edch   it also features several improvements similar to those of hsdpa  including multicode transmission  shorter transmission time interval enabling faster   link adaptation    fast scheduling  and fast   hybrid automatic repeat request    harq  with incremental redundancy  making   retransmission  data networks  retransmissions   more effective  similar to hsdpa  hsupa uses a  packet scheduler   but it operates a  requestgrant  principle where the   user equipment    ue  requests permission to send data and the scheduler decides when and how many ues will be allowed to do so  a request for transmission contains data about the state of the transmission buffer and the queue at the ue and its available power margin  however  unlike hsdpa  uplink transmissions are not   orthogonality  communicationsorthogonal   to each other  in addition to this  scheduled  mode of transmission  the standards allow a selfinitiated transmission mode from the ues  denoted  nonscheduled   the nonscheduled mode can  for example  be used for voip services for which even the reduced tti and the   node b   based scheduler are unable to provide the necessary short delay time and constant bandwidth  each macd flow  ie  qos flow  is configured to use either scheduled or nonscheduled modes  the ue adjusts the data rate for scheduled and nonscheduled flows independently  the maximum data rate of each nonscheduled flow is configured at call setup  and typically not frequently changed  the power used by the scheduled flows is controlled dynamically by the node b through absolute grant  consisting of an actual value  and relative grant  consisting of a single updown bit  messages  at the   physical layer    hsupa introduces the following new channels   eagch  absolute grant channel   ergch  relative grant channel   fdpch  fractionaldpch   ehich  edch hybrid arq indicator channel   edpcch  edch dedicated physical control channel   carries the control information associated with the edch transport channel  edpdch  edch dedicated physical data channel   carries the edch transport channel
