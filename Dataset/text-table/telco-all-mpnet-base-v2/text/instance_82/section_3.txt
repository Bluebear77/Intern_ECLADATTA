Title: User equipment categories

Value:
the following table is derived from table 51a of the release 11 of 3gpp ts 25306  ref  3gpp ts 25306 v1100 http  www3gpporgftpspecshtmlinfo25306htm  ref  and shows maximum data rates of different device classes and by what combination of features they are achieved  the percell  perstream data rate is limited by the  maximum number of bits of an hsdsch transport block received within an hsdsch tti  and the  minimum intertti interval   the tti is 2 milliseconds  so  for example  cat 10 can decode 27952 bits  2 ms  13976 mbits  and not 144 mbits often claimed incorrectly   categories 14 and 11 have intertti intervals of 2 or 3  which reduces the maximum data rate by that factor  dualcell and mimo 2x2 each multiply the maximum data rate by 2  because multiple independent transport blocks are transmitted over different carriers or spatial streams  respectively  the data rates given in the table are rounded to one decimal point  further ue categories were defined from 3ggp release 7 onwards evolved hspa  hspa  and are listed in   evolved high speed packet access  user equipment  ue  categoriesevolved hsdpa ue categories
