Title: Guard interval for elimination of intersymbol interference

Value:
one key principle of ofdm is that since low symbol rate modulation schemes  ie  where the symbols are relatively long compared to the channel time characteristics  suffer less from   intersymbol interference   caused by   multipath propagation    it is advantageous to transmit a number of lowrate streams in parallel instead of a single highrate stream  since the duration of each symbol is long  it is feasible to insert a   guard interval   between the ofdm symbols  thus eliminating the intersymbol interference  the guard interval also eliminates the need for a   pulseshaping filter    and it reduces the sensitivity to time synchronization problems   a simple example  if one sends a million symbols per second using conventional singlecarrier modulation over a wireless channel  then the duration of each symbol would be one microsecond or less  this imposes severe constraints synchronization and necessitates the removal of multipath interference  if the same million symbols per second are spread among one thousand subchannels  the duration of each symbol can be longer by a factor of a thousand  ie  one millisecond  for orthogonality with approximately the same bandwidth  assume that a guard interval of 18 of the symbol length is inserted between each symbol  intersymbol interference can be avoided if the multipath timespreading  the time between the reception of the first and the last echo  is shorter than the guard interval  ie  125 microseconds   this corresponds to a maximum difference of 375 kilometers between the lengths of the paths  the   cyclic prefix    which is transmitted during the guard interval  consists of the end of the ofdm symbol copied into the guard interval  and the guard interval is transmitted followed by the ofdm symbol  the reason that the guard interval consists of a copy of the end of the ofdm symbol is so that the receiver will integrate over an integer number of sinusoid cycles for each of the multipaths when it performs ofdm demodulation with the fft    file  ofdmcyclicprefixinsertionsvg800pxcenter   in some standards such   ultrawideband    in the interest of transmitted power  cyclic prefix is skipped and nothing is sent during the guard interval  the receiver will then have to mimic the cyclic prefix functionality by copying the end part of the ofdm symbol and adding it to the beginning portion
