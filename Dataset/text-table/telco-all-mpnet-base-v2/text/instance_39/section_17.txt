Title: Linear transmitter power amplifier

Value:
an ofdm signal exhibits a high   crest factorpeaktoaverage power ratio  papr    because the independent phases of the subcarriers mean that they will often combine constructively  handling this high papr requires   a highresolution   digitaltoanalog converter    dac  in the transmitter  a highresolution   analogtodigital converter    adc  in the receiver  a linear   signal chain   any nonlinearity in the signal chain will cause   intermodulation distortion   that  raises the noise floor  may cause intercarrier interference  generates outofband spurious radiation the linearity requirement is demanding  especially for transmitter rf output circuitry where amplifiers are often designed to be nonlinear in order to minimise power consumption  in practical ofdm systems a small amount of peak clipping is allowed to limit the papr in a judicious tradeoff against the above consequences  however  the transmitter output filter which is required to reduce outofband spurs to legal levels has the effect of restoring peak levels that were clipped  so clipping is not an effective way to reduce papr  although the spectral efficiency of ofdm is attractive for both terrestrial and space communications  the high papr requirements have so far limited ofdm applications to terrestrial systems  the crest factor cf  in db  for an ofdm system with uncorrelated subcarriers is  ref name  kaehs     cite weburlhttps  karriererohdeschwarzdecareercdnpullrscommonfileadmincustomerdownloadspdfhuellkurve_engpdftitlethe crest factor in dvbt  ofdm  transmitter systems and its influence the dimensioning of power componentsauthorbernhard kaehsdatejanuary 2007publisherrohde  schwarzarchiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20140705103705http  cdnrohdeschwarzcomdl_downloadsdl_applicationapplication_notes7ts027ts02_2epdfarchivedate20140705urlstatusdead    ref    math  cf  10 log_  10     cf_c  math  where cf  sub   sub  is the crest factor  in db  for each subcarrier   cf  sub   sub  is 301 db for the sine waves used for bpsk and qpsk modulation   for example  the dvbt signal in 2k mode is composed of 1705 subcarriers that are each qpskmodulated  giving a crest factor of 3532 db  ref name  kaehs    many papr  or   crest factor    reduction techniques have been developed  for instance  based iterative clipping  ref    cite journal last1wang first1yc  last2luo first2zq  titleoptimized iterative clipping and filtering for papr reduction of ofdm signals journalieee transactions communications datejanuary 2011 volume59 issue1 pages3337 doi101109tcomm2010102910090040s2cid2487860    ref  over the years  numerous modeldriven approaches have been proposed to reduce the papr in communication systems  in recent years  there has been a growing interest in exploring datadriven models for papr reduction part of ongoing research in endtoend communication networks  these datadriven models offer innovative solutions and new avenues of exploration to address the challenges posed by high papr effectively  by leveraging datadriven techniques  researchers aim to enhance the performance and efficiency of communication networks by optimizing power utilization   ref    cite conference last1huleihel first1yara last2bendrorfirst2eilam last3permuter first3haim h  titlelow papr waveform design for ofdm systems based convolutional autoencoder conference2020 ieee international conference advanced networks and telecommunications systems  ants  date2020 pages16    ref  the   dynamic range   required for an fm receiver is   nowrap120 db   while dab only require about   nowrap90 db     ref namedabpr    cite booktitledigital audio broadcasting  principles and applications of dab  dab  and dmb urlhttps  booksgooglecombooks  idt0ksa6w3qh4c  pgpa333 page333 year2009 last1hoeg first1wolfgang last2lauterbach first2thomas publisherjohn wiley  sons edition3rd accessdate20130704isbn9780470746196    ref  a comparison  each extra bit per sample increases the dynamic range by   nowrap6 db
