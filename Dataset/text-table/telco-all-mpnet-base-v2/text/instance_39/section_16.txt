Title: Space diversity

Value:
in ofdmbased widearea broadcasting  receivers can benefit from receiving signals from several spatially dispersed transmitters simultaneously  since transmitters will only destructively interfere with each other a limited number of subcarriers  whereas in general they will actually reinforce coverage over a wide area  this is very beneficial in many countries  it permits the operation of national   singlefrequency network    sfn   where many transmitters send the same signal simultaneously over the same channel frequency  sfns use the available spectrum more effectively than conventional multifrequency broadcast networks    multifrequency networkmfn     where program content is replicated different carrier frequencies  sfns also result in a   diversity gain   in receivers situated midway between the transmitters  the coverage area is increased and the outage probability decreased in comparison to an mfn  due to increased received signal strength averaged over all subcarriers  although the guard interval only contains redundant data  which means that it reduces the capacity  some ofdmbased systems  such some of the broadcasting systems  deliberately use a long guard interval in order to allow the transmitters to be spaced farther apart in an sfn  and longer guard intervals allow larger sfn cellsizes  a rule of thumb for the maximum distance between transmitters in an sfn is equal to the distance a signal travels during the guard interval  for instance  a guard interval of 200 microseconds would allow transmitters to be spaced 60 km apart  a single frequency network is a form of transmitter   macrodiversity    the concept can be further used in   dynamic singlefrequency networks    dsfn   where the sfn grouping is changed from timeslot to timeslot  ofdm may be combined with other forms of   space diversity    for example   phased arrayantenna arrays   and   mimo   channels  this is done in the   ieee 80211     wireless lan   standards
