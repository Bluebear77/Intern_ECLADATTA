Title: Orthogonality

Value:
conceptually  ofdm is a specialized   frequencydivision multiplexing    fdm  method  with the additional constraint that all subcarrier signals within a communication channel are orthogonal to one another  in ofdm  the subcarrier frequencies are chosen so that the subcarriers are   orthogonality  telecommunicationsorthogonal   to each other  meaning that   crosstalk   between the subchannels is eliminated and intercarrier guard bands are not required  this greatly simplifies the design of both the   transmitter   and the   receiver  radio  receiver    unlike conventional fdm  a separate filter for each subchannel is not required  the orthogonality requires that the subcarrier spacing is  math  scriptstyledelta f     frac  k   t_u   math    hertz    where  sub  u  sub    second   is the useful symbol duration  the receiverside window size   and k is a positive integer  typically equal to 1  this stipulates that each carrier frequency undergoes k more complete cycles per symbol period than the previous carrier  therefore  with subcarriers  the total passband bandwidth will be b  nδf  hz   the orthogonality also allows high   spectral efficiency    with a total symbol rate near the   nyquist rate   for the equivalent baseband signal  ie  near half the nyquist rate for the doubleside band physical passband signal   almost the whole available frequency band can be used  ofdm generally has a nearly white  spectrum  giving it benign electromagnetic interference properties with respect to other cochannel users   a simple example  a useful symbol duration  sub  u  sub   1 ms would require a subcarrier spacing of  math  scriptstyledelta f     frac  1   1  mathrm  ms       1  mathrm  khz   math   or an integer multiple of that  for orthogonality   1000 subcarriers would result in a total passband bandwidth of nδf  1 mhz  for this symbol time  the required bandwidth in theory according to nyquist is  math  scriptstylemathrm  bw  r2  nt_u  2  05  mathrm  mhz   math   half of the achieved bandwidth required by our scheme   where r is the bit rate and where  1000 samples per symbol by fft  if a guard interval is applied  see below   nyquist bandwidth requirement would be even lower  the fft would result in  1000 samples per symbol  if no guard interval was applied  this would result in a base band complex valued signal with a sample rate of 1 mhz  which would require a baseband bandwidth of 05 mhz according to nyquist  however  the passband rf signal is produced by multiplying the baseband signal with a carrier waveform  ie  doublesideband quadrature amplitudemodulation  resulting in a passband bandwidth of 1 mhz  a singleside band  ssb  or vestigial sideband  vsb  modulation scheme would achieve almost half that bandwidth for the same symbol rate  ie  twice high spectral efficiency for the same symbol alphabet length   it is however more sensitive to multipath interference  ofdm requires very accurate frequency synchronization between the receiver and the transmitter  with frequency deviation the subcarriers will no longer be orthogonal  causing intercarrier interference  ici   ie  crosstalk between the subcarriers   frequency offsets are typically caused by mismatched transmitter and receiver oscillators  or by   doppler shift   due to movement  while doppler shift alone may be compensated for by the receiver  the situation is worsened when combined with   multipath interferencemultipath    reflections will appear at various frequency offsets  which is much harder to correct  this effect typically worsens speed increases   ref    cite bookdoi101109vetecf1999797150chapterthe effects of doppler spreads in ofdm  a  mobile radio systemstitlegateway to 21st century communications village  vtc 1999fall  ieee
