Title: Adaptive transmission

Value:
the resilience to severe channel conditions can be further enhanced if information about the channel is sent over a returnchannel  based this feedback information  adaptive   modulation    channel coding and power allocation may be applied across all subcarriers  or individually to each subcarrier  in the latter case  if a particular range of frequencies suffers from interference or attenuation  the carriers within that range can be disabled or made to run slower by applying more robust modulation or   error coding   to those subcarriers  the term   visible anchordiscrete multitone modulation    dmt  denotes ofdmbased communication systems that adapt the transmission to the channel conditions individually for each subcarrier  by means of socalled bitloading  examples are   adsl   and   vdsl    the upstream and downstream speeds can be varied by allocating either more or fewer carriers for each purpose  some forms of   rateadaptive dsl   use this feature in real time  so that the bitrate is adapted to the cochannel interference and bandwidth is allocated to whichever subscriber needs it most
