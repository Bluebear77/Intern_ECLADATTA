digital transmission   used in digital   modulation   for encoding digital  binary  data multiple   carrier wavecarrier   frequencies  ofdm has developed into a popular scheme for   wideband

divided into multiple streams  multiple closely spaced   orthogonal functionsorthogonal   subcarrier signals with overlapping spectra are transmitted  with each carrier   modulationmodulated   with   binary digitbits   from the incoming stream so multiple bits are being transmitted in parallel  ref namecobas  webeorg  2ghz bas relocation techfair  cofdm technology basics  20070302  ref  demodulation is based   fast fourier transform   algorithms  ofdm was improved by weinstein and ebert in 1971 with the introduction of a   guard interval    providing better orthogonality in transmission channels affected by multipath propagation  ref nameweinstein  each subcarrier  signal  is modulated with a conventional modulation scheme  such   quadrature amplitude modulation   or   phaseshift keying    at a low   symbol rate    this maintains total data rates similar to conventional singlecarrier modulation schemes in the same bandwidth  ref  ahmad r bahai  burton r saltzberg

frequencyselective   fading   due to   multipath propagationmultipath    without the need for complex equalization filters  channel   equalization  communications  equalization   is simplified because ofdm may be viewed using many slowly modulated   narrowband   signals rather than one rapidly modulated   wideband   signal  the low symbol rate makes the use of a guard interval between symbols affordable  making it possible to eliminate   intersymbol interference    isi  and use echoes and timespreading  in   analog television   visible   ghosting  television  ghosting   and blurring  respectively  to achieve a   diversity gain    ie  a   signaltonoise ratio   improvement  this mechanism also facilitates the design of   single frequency network    sfns  where several adjacent transmitters send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency  the signals from multiple distant transmitters may be recombined constructively  sparing interference of a traditional singlecarrier system  in coded orthogonal frequencydivision multiplexing  cofdm     forward error correction    convolutional coding  and timefrequency interleaving are applied to the signal being transmitted  this is done to overcome errors in mobile communication channels affected by multipath propagation and   doppler effect   cofdm was introduced by alard in 1986  ref namebrevet    cite
