Title: Implementation using the FFT algorithm

Value:
the orthogonality allows for efficient modulator and demodulator implementation using the   fast fourier transformfft   algorithm the receiver side  and inverse fft the sender side  although the principles and some of the benefits have been known since the 1960s  ofdm is popular for wideband communications today by way of lowcost   digital signal processing   components that can efficiently calculate the fft  the time to compute the inversefft or fft has to take less than the time for each symbol   ref namece883    cite thesis typebe  urlhttp  cesharifircourses85862ce883resourcesrootlecturesaboutofdmpdf titlethe suitability of ofdm a modulation technique for wireless telecommunications  with a cdma comparison authoreric lawrey dateoctober 1997    ref    rp84   which for example for   dvbt     nowrap  fft 8k    means the computation has to be done in   nowrap896 µs   or less  for an   gaps8192   point   fast fourier transformfft   this may be approximated to   ref namece883    clarifyreasonnormally complexity is said to be proportional to log2   per block for fft  ie  819213 when n8192dateseptember 2012     math  begin  align  mathrm  mips    frac  mathrm  computational complexity    t_mathrm  symbol   times 13 times 10  6     frac  147  456 times 2   896 times 10  6   times 13 times 10  6     428 end  align   math   mips    instructions per second  million instructions per secondmillion instructions per second   the computational demand approximately scales linearly with fft size so a double size fft needs double the amount of time and vice versa  ref namece883    rp83   a comparison an   pentium iiiintel pentium iii   cpu at 1266 ghz is able to calculate a   nowrap8192 point   fft in   nowrap576 µs   using   fftw     ref    cite web urlhttp  wwwfftworgspeedpentium31266ghz websitefftworg title1266 ghz pentium 3 date20060620    ref    pentium mintel pentium   at 16 ghz does it in   nowrap387 µs     ref    cite web urlhttp  wwwfftworgspeedpentiumm16ghzgcc websitefftworg title16 ghz pentium  banias   gnu compilers date20060620    ref    core duointel core duo   at 30 ghz does it in   nowrap968 µs     ref    cite web urlhttp  wwwfftworgspeedcoreduo30ghzicc websitefftworg title30 ghz intel core duo  intel compilers  32bit mode date20061009    ref
