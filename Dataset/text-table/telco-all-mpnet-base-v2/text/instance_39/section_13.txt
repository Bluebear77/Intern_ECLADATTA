Title: Channel coding and interleaving

Value:
ofdm is invariably used in conjunction with   channel coding      forward error correction     and almost always uses frequency andor time   bit interleavinginterleaving    frequency  subcarrier    bit interleavinginterleaving   increases resistance to frequencyselective channel conditions such   fading    for example  when a part of the channel bandwidth fades  frequency interleaving ensures that the bit errors that would result from those subcarriers in the faded part of the bandwidth are spread out in the bitstream rather than being concentrated  similarly  time interleaving ensures that bits that are originally close together in the bitstream are transmitted far apart in time  thus mitigating against severe fading would happen when travelling at high speed  however  time interleaving is of little benefit in slowly fading channels  such for stationary reception  and frequency interleaving offers little to no benefit for narrowband channels that suffer from flatfading  where the whole channel bandwidth fades at the same time   the reason why interleaving is used ofdm is to attempt to spread the errors out in the bitstream that is presented to the error correction decoder  because when such decoders are presented with a high concentration of errors the decoder is unable to correct all the bit errors  and a burst of uncorrected errors occurs  a similar design of audio data encoding makes compact disc  cd  playback robust  a classical type of error correction coding used with ofdmbased systems is   convolutional codeconvolutional coding    often   concatenated error correction codesconcatenated   with   reedsolomon error correctionreedsolomon   coding  usually  additional interleaving  top of the time and frequency interleaving mentioned above  in between the two layers of coding is implemented  the choice for reedsolomon coding the outer error correction code is based the observation that the viterbi decoder used for inner convolutional decoding produces short error bursts when there is a high concentration of errors  and reedsolomon codes are inherently well suited to correcting bursts of errors  newer systems  however  usually now adopt nearoptimal types of error correction codes that use the turbo decoding principle  where the decoder iterates towards the desired solution  examples of such error correction coding types include   turbo code   and   ldpc   codes  which perform close to the   shannon limit   for the additive white gaussian noise    additive white gaussian noiseawgn    channel  some systems that have implemented these codes have concatenated them with either reedsolomon  for example the   mediaflo   system  or   bch code    the   dvbs2   system  to improve upon an   error floor   inherent to these codes at high   signaltonoise ratio    ref name  bookmplc     cite booktitle mimo power line communications  narrow and broadband standards  emc  and advanced processing series devices  circuits  and systems datefebruary 2014editor berger  lars  editor2schwager  andreas editor3pagani  pascal editor4schneider  daniel mpublisher crc press page25doi101201b165401isbn9781466557536chapter introduction to power line communication channel and noise characterisation    ref
