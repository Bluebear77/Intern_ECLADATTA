Title: Wavelet-OFDM

Value:
ofdm has become an interesting technique for power line communications  plc   in this area of research  a wavelet transform is introduced to replace the dft the method of creating orthogonal frequencies  this is due to the advantages wavelets offer  which are particularly useful noisy power lines  ref namewaveletofdm    cite book authors  galli author2h  koga author3n  nodokama title2008 ieee international symposium power line communications and its applications chapteradvanced signal processing for plcs  waveletofdm atpp  187192 datemay 2008 doi101109isplc20084510421 urlhttps  wwwresearchgatenetpublication4330667isbn9781424419753 s2cid12146430    ref  instead of using an idft to create the sender signal  the wavelet ofdm uses a synthesis bank consisting of a  math   math  band transmultiplexer followed by the transform function   math  f_n  z   sum_  k0    l1  f_n  k  z  k   quad 0 leq   math  the receiver side  an analysis bank is used to demodulate the signal again  this bank contains an inverse transform   math  g_n  z   sum_  k0    l1  g_n  k  z  k   quad 0 leq   math  followed by another  math   math  band transmultiplexer  the relationship between both transform functions is   math  begin  align  f_n  k    g_n   1  k   f_n  z    z    l1   g_n   z  1  end  align   math  an example of wofdm uses the perfect reconstruction cosine modulated filter bank  prcmfb  and extended lapped transform  elt  is used for the wavelet tf  thus   math  textstyle f_n  k   math  and  math  textstyle g_n  k   math  are given   math  begin  align  f_n  k    2 p_0  k  cos left  frac  pi    left   frac  1   2  right  left  k  frac  l1   2  right    1     frac  pi   4  right   g_n  k    2 p_0  k  cos left  frac  pi    left   frac  1   2  right  left  k  frac  l1   2  right    1     frac  pi   4  right   p_0  z    sum_  k0    n1  z  k  y_kleft  z  2n  right  end  align   math  these two functions are their respective inverses  and can be used to modulate and demodulate a given input sequence  just in the case of dft  the wavelet transform creates orthogonal waves with  math  textstyle f_0  math    math  textstyle f_1  math      math  textstyle f_  n1   math   the orthogonality ensures that they do not interfere with each other and can be sent simultaneously  at the receiver   math  textstyle g_0  math    math  textstyle g_1  math      math  textstyle g_  n1   math  are used to reconstruct the data sequence once more
