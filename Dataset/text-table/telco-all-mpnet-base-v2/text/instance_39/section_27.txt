Title: Wireless local area networks (LAN) and metropolitan area networks (MAN)

Value:
ofdm is extensively used in wireless lan and man applications  including   ieee 80211ieee 80211agn   and   wimax    ieee 80211agn  operating in the 24 and 5 ghz bands  specifies perstream airside data rates ranging from 6 to 54 mbits  if both devices can use  ht mode   added with   80211n     the top 20 mhz perstream rate is increased to 722 mbits  with the option of data rates between 135 and 150 mbits using a 40 mhz channel  four different modulation schemes are used    bpsk      qpsk    16   qam    and 64qam  along with a set of error correcting rates  1256   the multitude of choices allows the system to adapt the optimum data rate for the current signal conditions
