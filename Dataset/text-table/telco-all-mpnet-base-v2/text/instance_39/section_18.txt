Title: Efficiency comparison between single carrier and multicarrier

Value:
the performance of any communication system can be measured in terms of its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency  the power efficiency describes the ability of communication system to preserve bit error rate    bit error rateber    of the transmitted signal at low power levels    bandwidth efficiency   reflects how efficiently the allocated bandwidth is used and is defined the throughput data rate per hertz in a given bandwidth  if the large number of subcarriers are used  the bandwidth efficiency of multicarrier system such ofdm with using   optical fiber channe   is defined  ref    cite book  authorwilliam shieh  ivan djordjevic   title  ofdm for optical communications    location 525 b street  suite 1900  san diego  california 921014495  usa  publisheracademic press  year2010    ref    math  eta  2 frac  r_s   b_text  ofdm    math  where  math  r_s  math  is the symbol rate in gigasymbols per second  gsps    math  b_text  ofdm   math  is the bandwidth of ofdm signal  and the factor of 2 is due to the two   polarization  waves  polarization   states in the fiber  there is saving of bandwidth by using multicarrier modulation with orthogonal frequencydivision multiplexing  so the bandwidth for multicarrier system is less in comparison with single carrier system and hence bandwidth efficiency of multicarrier system is larger than single carrier system  there is only 1   nbsp   db increase in receiver power  but we get 767  improvement in bandwidth efficiency with using multicarrier transmission technique
