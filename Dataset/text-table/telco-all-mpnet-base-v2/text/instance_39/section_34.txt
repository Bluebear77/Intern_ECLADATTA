Title: BST-OFDM used in ISDB

Value:
the bandsegmented transmission orthogonal frequencydivision multiplexing  bstofdm  system proposed for japan  in the   isdbt      isdbtsb    and   isdbc   broadcasting systems  improves upon cofdm by exploiting the fact that some ofdm carriers may be modulated differently from others within the same multiplex  some forms of cofdm already offer this kind of   hierarchical modulation    though bstofdm is intended to make it more flexible  the 6 mhz television channel may therefore be  segmented   with different segments being modulated differently and used for different services  it is possible  for example  to send an audio service a segment that includes a segment composed of a number of carriers  a data service another segment and a television service yet another segmentall within the same 6 mhz television channel  furthermore  these may be modulated with different parameters so that  for example  the audio and data services could be optimized for mobile reception  while the television service is optimized for stationary reception in a highmultipath environment
