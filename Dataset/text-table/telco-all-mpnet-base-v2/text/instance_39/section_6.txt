Title: Summary of advantages

Value:
 high   spectral efficiency   compared to other double   sideband   modulation schemes    spread spectrum    etc  can easily adapt to severe channel conditions without complex timedomain equalization   robust against narrowband cochannel interference  robust against   intersymbol interference    isi  and fading caused by multipath propagation  efficient implementation using   fast fourier transform    low sensitivity to time synchronization errors  tuned subchannel receiver filters are not required  unlike conventional   frequencydivision multiplexingfdm     facilitates   single frequency network    sfns   ie  transmitter   macrodiversity
