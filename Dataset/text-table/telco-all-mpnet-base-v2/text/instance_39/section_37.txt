Title: Vector OFDM (VOFDM)

Value:
vofdm was proposed by xianggen xia in 2000  proceedings of icc 2000  new orleans  and ieee trans  communications  aug  2001  for single transmit antenna systems  vofdm replaces each scalar value in the conventional ofdm by a vector value and is a bridge between ofdm and the single carrier frequency domain equalizer  scfde   when the vector size is  math  1  math   it is ofdm and when the vector size is at least the channel length and the fft size is  math  1  math   it is scfde  in vofdm  assume  math   math  is the vector size  and each scalarvalued signal  math  x_n  math  in ofdm is replaced by a vectorvalued signal  math   bf x  _n  math  of vector size  math   math    math  0leq nleq n1  math   one takes the  math   math  point ifft of  math   bf x  _n  0 leq leq  1  math   componentwisely and gets another vector sequence of the same vector size  math   math    math   bf x  _k  0 leq k leq  1  math   then  one adds a vector cp of length  math  gamma  math  to this vector sequence   math   bf x  _0   bf x  _1     bf x  _  n1    bf x  _0   bf x  _1     bf x  _  gamma1   math   this vector sequence is converted to a scalar sequence by sequentializing all the vectors of size  math   math   which is transmitted at a transmit antenna sequentially  at the receiver  the received scalar sequence is first converted to the vector sequence of vector size  math   math   when the cp length satisfies  math display  inline   gamma geq leftlceil frac     rightrceil  math   then  after the vector cp is removed from the vector sequence and the  math   math  point fft is implemented componentwisely to the vector sequence of length  math   math   one obtains   math   bf  _n   bf h  _n  bf x  _n   bf w  _n      0 leq leq  1                               1   math  where  math   bf w  _n  math  are additive white noise and  math display  inline    bf h  _n   bf h  mathordleft  expmathordleft  frac  2pi jn    right  right    bf h   z  _  zexp  2pi nn    math  and  math   bf h   z   math  is the following  math  times  math  polyphase matrix of the isi channel  math display  inline   h  z   sum_  k0  h_k z  k   math     math  mathbf  h   z   left  begin  array   cccc

display  inline   h_m  z   sum_l h_  mlm  z    math  is the  math   math  th polyphase component of the channel  math  h  z   0 leq leq  1  math   from  1   one can see that the original isi channel is converted to  math   math  many vector subchannels of vector size  math   math   there is no isi across these vector subchannels but there is isi inside each vector subchannel  in each vector subchannel  at most  math   math  many symbols are interfered each other  clearly  when the vector size  math   1  math   the above vofdm returns to ofdm and when  math    math  and  math   1  math   it becomes the scfde  the vector size  math   math  is a parameter that one can choose freely and properly in practice and controls the isi level  there may be a tradeoff between vector size  math   math   demodulation complexity at the receiver  and fft size  for a given channel bandwidth  note that the length of the cp part in the sequential form does not have to be an integer multiple of the vector size   math  gamma  math   one can truncate the above vectorized cp to a sequential cp of length not less than the isi channel length  which will not affect the above demodulation  also note that there exist many other different generalizationsforms of ofdm  to see their essential differences  it is critical to see their corresponding received signal equations to demodulate  the above vofdm is the earliest and the only one that achieves the received signal equation  1  andor its equivalent form  although it may have different implementations at transmitter vs  different ifft algorithms  it has been shown  yabo li al  ieee trans  signal processing  oct  2012  that applying the mmse linear receiver to each vector subchannel  1   it achieves multipath diversity andor signal space diversity  this is because the vectorized channel matrices in  1  are pseudocirculant and can be diagonalized by the  math   math  point dftidft matrix with some diagonal phase shift matrices  then  the right hand side dftidft matrix and the  math  k  math  th diagonal phase shift matrix in the diagonalization can be thought of the precoding to the input information symbol vector  math   bf x  _k  math  in the  math  k  math  th sub vector channel  and all the vectorized subchannels become diagonal channels of  math   math  discrete frequency components from the  math  mn  math  point dft of the original isi channel  it may collect the multipath diversity andor signal space diversity similar to the precoding to collect the signal space diversity for single antenna systems to combat wireless fading or the diagonal spacetime block coding to collect the spatial diversity for multiple antenna systems  the details are referred to the ieee tcom and ieee tsp papers mentioned above
