Title: Other orthogonal transforms

Value:
the vast majority of implementations of ofdm use the fast fourier transform  fft   however  in principle  any orthogonal transform algorithm could be used instead of the fft  ofdm systems based  instead  the   discrete hartley transform    dht   ref   k jao    long  and  shiue   the dhtbased multicarrier tranceiver over multipath fading channel   2009 ieee 20th international symposium personal  indoor and mobile radio communications  2009 pp  16621666    doi101109pimrc20095450277    ref  and the   wavelet transform   have been investigated
