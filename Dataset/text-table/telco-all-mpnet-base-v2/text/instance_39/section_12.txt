Title: Simplified equalization

Value:
the effects of frequencyselective channel conditions  for example fading caused by multipath propagation  can be considered constant  flat  over an ofdm subchannel if the subchannel is sufficiently narrowbanded  ie  if the number of subchannels is sufficiently large   this makes frequency domain equalization possible at the   receiver  radio  receiver    which is far simpler than the timedomain equalization used in conventional singlecarrier modulation  in ofdm  the equalizer only has to multiply each detected subcarrier  each fourier coefficient  in each ofdm symbol by a constant complex number  or a rarely changed value  a fundamental level  simpler digital equalizers are better because they require fewer operations  which translates to fewer roundoff errors in the equalizer  those roundoff errors can be viewed numerical noise and are inevitable   our example  the ofdm equalization in the above numerical example would require one complex valued multiplication per subcarrier and symbol  ie   math  scriptstyle     1000  math  complex multiplications per ofdm symbol  ie  one million multiplications per second  at the receiver   the fft algorithm requires  math  scriptstyle log_2     10000  math   this is imprecise  over half of these complex multiplications are trivial  ie   to 1 and are not implemented in software or hw   complexvalued multiplications per ofdm symbol  ie  10 million multiplications per second   at both the receiver and transmitter side  this should be compared with the corresponding one million symbolssecond singlecarrier modulation case mentioned in the example  where the equalization of 125 microseconds timespreading using a   fir filter   would require  in a naive implementation  125 multiplications per symbol  ie  125 million multiplications per second   fft techniques can be used to reduce the number of multiplications for an   fir filter   based timedomain equalizer to a number comparable with ofdm  at the cost of delay between reception and decoding which also becomes comparable with ofdm  if differential modulation such   dpsk   or   dqpsk   is applied to each subcarrier  equalization can be completely omitted  since these noncoherent schemes are insensitive to slowly changing amplitude and   phase distortion    in a sense  improvements in fir equalization using ffts or partial ffts leads mathematically closer to ofdm    citation neededdatejanuary 2011   but the ofdm technique is easier to understand and implement  and the subchannels can be independently adapted in other ways than varying equalization coefficients  such switching between different   qam   constellation patterns and errorcorrection schemes to match individual subchannel noise and interference characteristics    clarifydatejanuary 2011   some of the subcarriers in some of the ofdm symbols may carry   pilot signal   for measurement of the channel conditions  ref    cite journal vauthorscoleri  ergen  puri a
