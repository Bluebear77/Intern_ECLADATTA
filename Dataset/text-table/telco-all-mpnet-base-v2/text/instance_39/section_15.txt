Title: OFDM extended with multiple access

Value:
  mainorthogonal frequencydivision multiple access   ofdm in its primary form is considered a digital modulation technique  and not a multiuser   channel access method    since it is used for transferring one bit stream over one communication channel using one sequence of ofdm symbols  however  ofdm can be combined with   multiple access   using time  frequency or coding separation of the users  in   orthogonal frequencydivision multiple access    ofdma     frequencydivision multiple access   is achieved by assigning different ofdm subchannels to different users  ofdma supports differentiated   quality of service   by assigning different number of subcarriers to different users in a similar fashion in   cdma    and thus complex packet scheduling or   media access control   schemes can be avoided  ofdma is used in   the mobility mode of the   ieee 80216   wireless man standard  commonly referred to wimax   the   ieee 80220   mobile wireless man standard  commonly referred to mbwa   the   3gpp long term evolution    lte  fourth generation mobile broadband standard downlink  the radio interface was formerly named high speed ofdm packet access  hsopa   now named evolved umts terrestrial radio access    eutra      the   5g nr3gpp 5g nr    new radio  fifth generation mobile network standard downlink and uplink  5g nr is the successor to lte   the now defunct   qualcomm      3gpp2     ultra mobile broadband    umb  project  intended a successor of   cdma2000    but replaced by lte  ofdma is also a candidate access method for the   ieee 80222   wireless regional area networks  wran   the project aims at designing the first   cognitive radio   based standard operating in the vhflow uhf spectrum  tv spectrum    the most recent amendment of   80211   standard  namely   80211ax    includes ofdma for high efficiency and simultaneous communication  in   multicarrier codedivision multiple access    mccdma   also known ofdmcdma  ofdm is combined with cdma spread spectrum communication for coding separation of the users  cochannel interference can be mitigated  meaning that manual   fixed channel allocation    fca  frequency planning is simplified  or complex   dynamic channel allocation    dca  schemes are avoided
