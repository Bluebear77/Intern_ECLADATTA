  file  ofdm transmitter idealpngcenter754px   an ofdm carrier signal is the sum of a number of orthogonal subcarriers  with   baseband   data each subcarrier being independently modulated commonly using some type of   quadrature amplitude modulation    qam  or   phaseshift keying    psk   this composite baseband signal is typically used to modulate a main   radio frequencyrf   carrier   math     math  is a serial stream of binary digits  by   inverse multiplexing    these are first demultiplexed into  math   math  parallel streams  and each one mapped to a  possibly complex  symbol stream using some modulation constellation    qam      phaseshift keyingpsk    etc   note that the constellations may be different  so some streams may carry a higher bitrate than others  an inverse   fast fourier transformfft   is computed each set of symbols  giving a set of complex timedomain samples  these samples are then   quadrature phasequadrature   mixed to passband in the standard way  the real and imaginary components are first converted to the analogue domain using   digitaltoanalogue converter    dacs   the analogue signals are then used to modulate   cosine   and   sine   waves at the   carrier signalcarrier   frequency   math  f_text    math   respectively  these signals are then summed to give the transmission signal   math     math
