Title: Advantages over standard OFDM

Value:
wofdm is an evolution of the standard ofdm  with certain advantages  mainly  the sidelobe levels of wofdm are lower  this results in less ici  well greater robustness to narrowband interference  these two properties are especially useful in plc  where most of the lines are nt shielded against emnoise  which creates noisy channels and noise spikes  a comparison between the two modulation techniques also reveals that the complexity of both algorithms remains approximately the same  ref namewaveletofdm
