Title: Data link layer

Value:
the dect   media access control   layer controls the physical layer and provides   connection oriented      connectionless   and   broadcastingbroadcast   services to the higher layers  the dect   data link layer   uses link access protocol control  lapc   a specially designed variant of the   integrated services digital networkisdn   data link protocol called lapd  they are based   hdlc    gfsk modulation uses a bit rate of 1152 kbits  with a frame of 10   nbsp   ms  11520   nbsp   bits  which contains 24 time slots  each slots contains 480 bits  some of which are reserved for physical packets and the rest is guard space  slots 011 are always used for downlink  fp to pp  and slots 1223 are used for uplink  pp to fp   there are several combinations of slots and corresponding types of physical packets with gfsk modulation   basic packet  p32    snd   420 or 424 bits  full slot   used for normal speech transmission  user data  bfield  contains 320 bits   lowcapacity packet  p00    snd   96 bits at the beginning of the time slot   short slot    this packet only contains 64bit header  afield  used a dummy bearer to broadcast base station identification when idle   variable capacity packet  p00j    snd   100  or 104  bits  either two halfslots  0   136  or  long slot   137   856   user data  bfield  contains bits    p64   640   p67   672    snd    long slot   used by ngdectcatiq wideband voice and data   highcapacity packet  p80    snd   900 or 904 bits   double slot   this packet uses two time slots and always begins in an even time slot  the bfield is increased to 800 bits  the 420424 bits of a gfsk basic packet  p32  contain the following fields   32 bits   snd   synchronization code  sfield   constant bit string aaaae98ah for fp transmission  55551675h for pp transmission  388 bits   snd   data  dfield   including   64 bits   snd   header  afield   control traffic in logical channels    p  and q   320 bits   snd   user data  bfield   dect payload  ie  voice data   4 bits   snd   errorchecking  xfield   crc of the bfield  4 bits   snd   collision detectionchannel quality  zfield   optional  contains a copy of the xfield the resulting full data rate is 32 kbits  available in both directions
