Title: Network layer

Value:
the dect   network layer   always contains the following protocol entities   call control  cc   mobility management  mm  optionally it may also contain others   call independent supplementary services  ciss   connection oriented message service  coms   connectionless message service  clms  all these communicate through a link control entity  lce   the call control protocol is derived from   isdn     dss1    which is a   q931   derived protocol  many dectspecific changes have been made    specifydatejune 2010   the mobility management protocol includes the management of identities  authentication  location updating  onair subscription and key allocation  it includes many elements similar to the gsm protocol  but also includes elements unique to dect  unlike the gsm protocol  the dect network specifications do not define crosslinkages between the operation of the entities  for example  mobility management and call control   the architecture presumes that such linkages will be designed into the interworking unit that connects the dect access network to whatever mobilityenabled fixed network is involved  by keeping the entities separate  the handset is capable of responding to any combination of entity traffic  and this creates great flexibility in fixed network design without breaking full interoperability  dect   generic access profilegap   is an interoperability profile for dect  the intent is that two different products from different manufacturers that both conform not only to the dect standard  but also to the gap profile defined within the dect standard  are able to interoperate for basic calling  the dect standard includes full testing suites for gap  and gap products the market from different manufacturers are in practice interoperable for the basic functions
