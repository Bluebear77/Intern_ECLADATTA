Title: Standards history

Value:
the dect standard was developed by   etsi   in several phases  the first of which took place between 1988 and 1992 when the first round of standards were published  these were the ets 300175 series in nine parts defining the air interface  and ets 300176 defining how the units should be type approved  a technical report  etr178  was also published to explain the standard  ref nametr101178    cite

enrico tosato of italy  to reflect its broader range of application including data services  in 1995  due to its more global usage  the name was changed from european to enhanced  dect is recognized

developed by etsi but has since been adopted by many countries all over the world  the original dect frequency band  18801900 mhz  is used in all countries in   europe    outside europe  it is used in most of   asia      australia   and   south america    in the   united states    the   federal communications commission   in 2005 changed channelization and licensing costs in a nearby band  19201930
