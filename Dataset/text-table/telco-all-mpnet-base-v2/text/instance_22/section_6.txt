Title: Technical features

Value:
the dect standard specifies a means for a   portable phone   or  portable part  to access a fixed telephone network via radio    base station   or  fixed part  is used to terminate the radio link and provide access to a fixed line  a   gateway  telecommunications  gateway   is then used to connect calls to the fixed network  such   public switched telephone network    telephone jack   office pbx  isdn  or voip over ethernet connection  typical abilities of a domestic dect   generic access profilegeneric access profile    gap  system include multiple handsets to one base station and one phone line socket  this allows several cordless telephones to be placed around the house  all operating from the same telephone jack  additional handsets have a battery charger station that does not plug into the telephone system  handsets can in many cases be used   intercom    communicating between each other  and sometimes   walkietalkie    intercommunicating without telephone line connection  dect operates in the 18801900 mhz band and defines ten frequency channels from 1881792 mhz to 1897344 mhz with a band gap of 1728 khz  dect operates a multicarrier   frequencydivision multiple access    fdma  and   timedivision multiple access    tdma  system  this means that the   radio spectrum   is divided into physical carriers in two dimensions  frequency and time  fdma access provides up to 10 frequency channels  and tdma access provides 24 time slots per every frame of 10   nbsp   ms  dect uses   timedivision duplex    tdd   which means that down and uplink use the same frequency but different time slots  thus a base station provides 12 duplex speech channels in each frame  with each time slot occupying any available channel   snd   thus 10  12  120 carriers are available  each carrying 32 kbits  dect also provides   frequencyhopping spread spectrum   over   timedivision multiple accesstdma   tdd structure for ism band applications  if frequencyhopping is avoided  each base station can provide up to 120 channels in the dect spectrum before frequency reuse  each timeslot can be assigned to a different channel in order to exploit advantages of frequency hopping and to avoid interference from other users in asynchronous fashion  ref    cite bookurlhttps  booksgooglecombooks  idvmpt8b5_tac  pgpa587titlewireless communications  principles and practice  2elastsfirstrappaport theodoredateseptember 2010publisherpearson educationisbn9788131731864page587    ref  dect allows interferencefree wireless operation to around   convert100myd   outdoors  indoor performance is reduced when interior spaces are constrained by walls  dect performs with fidelity in common congested domestic radio traffic situations  it is generally immune to interference from other dect systems    wifi   networks    video sender      bluetooth   technology  baby monitors and other wireless devices
