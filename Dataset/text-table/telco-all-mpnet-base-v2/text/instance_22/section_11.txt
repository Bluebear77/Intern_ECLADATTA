Title: Security

Value:
the dect media access control layer includes authentication of handsets to the base station using the dect standard authentication algorithm  dsaa   when registering the handset the base  both record a shared 128bit unique authentication key  uak   the base can request authentication by sending two random numbers to the handset  which calculates the response using the shared 128bit key  the handset can also request authentication by sending a 64bit random number to the base  which chooses a second random number  calculates the response using the shared key  and sends it back with the second random number  the standard also provides   encryption   services with the dect standard cipher  dsc   the encryption is   key sizefairly weak    using a 35bit   initialization vector   and encrypting the voice stream with 64bit encryption  while most of the dect standard is publicly available  the part describing the dect standard cipher was only available under a   nondisclosure agreement   to the phones  manufacturers from   european telecommunications standards instituteetsi    the properties of the dect protocol make it hard to intercept a frame  modify it and send it later again  dect frames are based timedivision multiplexing and need to be transmitted at a specific point in time  ref nametewsdectworld2016  unfortunately very few dect devices the market implemented authentication and encryption procedures  ref nametewsdectworld2016  dr  dect secturity  present  past  future  dect world 2016 presentations   webarchiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20210419200215https  wwwdectorguserfilesfiledect  20world  202016presentationsdf_dect  20world  202016  20presentationszip date19 april 2021    erik tews  university of birmingham  31 may 2016  ref   ref name  25c3      snd   and even when encryption was used by the phone  it was possible to implement a   maninthemiddle attack   impersonating a dect base station and revert to unencrypted mode   snd   which allows calls to be listened to  recorded  and rerouted to a different destination  ref name  25c3     ref namersa2009dectauthentication  lucks  stefan  schuler  andreas  tews  erik  weinmann  ralfphilipp  wenzel  matthias  attacks the dect authentication mechanisms  fischlin  marc  ed   topics in cryptology   snd   ctrsa 2009  the cryptographers  track at the rsa conference 2009  san francisco  ca  usa  april 2024  2009  ref   ref nametewsdectsecurity  erik tews  dect security analysis  phd  thesis   technische universit√§t darmstadt  ref  after an unverified report of a successful attack in 2002   ref    cite newsgroupmessageidadsq2u  p00  1  wanadoofrnewsgroupaltanonymousmessagestitledo you like ice cream  urlhttps  groupsgooglecomgroupaltanonymousmessagesbrowse_threadthreadd311d0ebbe5038350e28cfbc393d174cwebsitegroupsgooglecomaccessdate2 january 2018    ref   ref    cite web urlhttp  listsgnumonksorgpipermaildedected2009january000432html titledsc   snd   reverse engineering of the samsung dect spr6150 date26 january 2009 firstralfphilipp lastweinmann urlstatusdead archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20120226025256http  listsgnumonksorgpipermaildedected2009january000432html archivedate26 february 2012 dfdmy    ref  members of the dedectedorg project actually did reverse engineer the dect standard cipher in 2008   ref name  25c3     cite news  url  http  wwwhonlinecomsecuritynewsitem25c3serioussecurityvulnerabilitiesindectwirelesstelephony739493html  title  serious security vulnerabilities in dect wireless telephony publisher  heise online  date 29 december 2008    ref  and of 2010 there has been a viable attack it that can recover the key  ref name  dscanalysis     cite web  url  https  wwwdatenzonedeblogwpcontentuploads201606cryptanalysisofthedectstandardcipherpdf  title  cryptanalysis of the dect standard cipher  first1  karsten  last1  nohl  first2  erik  last2  tews  first3  ralfphilipp  last3  weinmann  date 4 april 2010 workfast software encryption  17th international workshop  fse 2010  seoul  korea    ref  in 2012  an improved authentication algorithm  the dect standard authentication algorithm 2  dsaa2   and improved version of the encryption algorithm  the dect standard cipher 2  dsc2   both based   advanced encryption standardaes   128bit encryption  were included optional in the ngdectcatiq suite  dect forum also launched the dect security certification program which mandates the use of previously optional security features in the gap profile  such early encryption and base authentication
