Title: Physical layer

Value:
the dect   physical layer   uses fdmatdma access with tdd    gaussian frequencyshift keying    gfsk  modulation is used  the binary one is coded with a frequency increase by 288 khz  and the binary zero with frequency decrease of 288 khz  with high quality connections  2  4 or 8level differential psk modulation  dbpsk  dqpsk or d8psk   which is similar to qam2  qam4 and qam8  can be used to transmit 1  2  or 3 bits per each symbol  qam16 and qam64 modulations with 4 and 6 bits per symbol can be used for user data  bfield  only  with resulting transmission speeds of up to 5068   nbsp   mbits  dect provides dynamic channel selection and assignment  the choice of transmission frequency and time slot is always made by the mobile terminal  in case of interference in the selected frequency channel  the mobile terminal  possibly from suggestion by the base station  can initiate either intracell handover  selecting another channeltransmitter the same base  or intercell handover  selecting a different base station altogether  for this purpose  dect devices scan all idle channels at regular 30   nbsp   intervals to generate a received signal strength indication  rssi  list  when a new channel is required  the mobile terminal  pp  or base station  fp  selects a channel with the minimum interference from the rssi list  the maximum allowed power for portable equipment well base stations is 250 mw  a portable device radiates an average of about 10 mw during a call it is only using one of 24 time slots to transmit  in europe  the power limit was expressed   effective radiated power    erp   rather than the more commonly used   equivalent isotropically radiated power    eirp   permitting the use of highgain directional antennas to produce much higher eirp and hence long ranges
