Title: Call processing

Value:
a conversation data bits makes up the data field  six slots make up a complete is54 frame  data in slots 1 and 4  2 and 5  and 3 and 6 make up a voice circuit  dvcc stands for digital verification color code  arcane terminology for a unique 8bit code value assigned to each cell  g means guard time  the period between each time slot  rsvd stands for reserved  sync represents synchronization  a critical tdma data field  each slot in every frame must be synchronized against all others and a master clock for everything to work  time slots for the mobiletobase direction are constructed differently from the basetomobile direction  they essentially carry the same information but are arranged differently  notice that the mobiletobase direction has a 6bit ramp time to enable its transmitter time to get up to full power  and a 6bit guard band during which nothing is transmitted  these 12 extra bits in the basetomobile direction are reserved for future use  once a call comes in the mobile switches to a different pair of frequencies  a voice radio channel which the system carrier has made analog or digital  this pair carries the call  if an is54 signal is detected it gets assigned a digital traffic channel if one is available  the fast associated channel or facch performs handoffs during the call  with no need for the mobile to go back to the control channel  in case of high noise  facch embedded within the digital traffic channel overrides the voice payload  degrading speech quality to convey control information  the purpose is to maintain connectivity  the slow associated control channel or sacch does not perform handoffs but conveys things like signal strength information to the base station  the is54 speech coder uses the technique called   vector sum excited linear predictionvector sum excited linear prediction    vselp  coding  this is a special type of speech coder within a large class known   code excited linear predictioncodeexcited linear prediction    celp  coders  the speech coding rate of 795 kbits achieves a reconstructed speech quality similar to that of the analog amps system using frequency modulation  the 795kbits signal is then passed through a channel coder that loads the bit rate up to 13 kbits  the new halfrate coding standard reduces the overall bit rate for each call to 65 kbits  and should provide comparable quality to the 13kbits rate  this halfrate gives a channel capacity six times that of analog amps
