is54 employs the same 30 khz channel spacing and frequency bands  824849 and 869894 mhz  amps  capacity was increased over the preceding analog design by dividing each 30 khz channel pair into three time slots and digitally compressing the voice data  yielding three times the call capacity in a single cell  a digital system also made calls more secure because analog scanners could not access digital signals  the is54 standard specifies 84 control channels  42 of which are shared with amps  to maintain compatibility with the existing amps cellular telephone system  the primary forward and reverse control channels in is54 cellular systems use the same signaling techniques and modulation scheme  binary fsk  amps  an ampsis54 infrastructure can support use of either analog amps phones or damps phones  the access method used for is54 is time division multiple access  tdma   which was the first us  digital standard to be developed  it was adopted by the tia in 1992  tdma subdivides each of the 30 khz amps channels into three fullrate tdma channels  each of which is capable of supporting a single voice call  later  each of these fullrate channels was further subdivided into two halfrate channels  each of which  with the necessary coding and compression  could also support a voice call  thus  tdma could provide three to six times the capacity of amps traffic channels  tdma was initially defined by the is54 standard and is now specified in the is13x series of specifications of the eiatia  the channel transmission bit rate for digitally modulating the carrier is 486 kbits  each frame has six time slots of 667ms duration  each time slot carries 324 bits of information  of which 260 bits are for the 13kbits fullrate traffic data  the other 64 bits are overhead  28 of these are for synchronization  and they contain a specific bit sequence known by all receivers to establish frame alignment  also  with gsm  the known sequence acts a training pattern to initialize an adaptive equalizer  the is54 system has different synchronization sequences for each of the six time slots making up the frame  thereby allowing each receiver to synchronize to its own preassigned time slots  an additional 12 bits in every time slot are for the sacch  ie  system control information   the digital verification color code  dvcc  is the equivalent of the supervisory audio tone used in the amps system  there are 256 different 8bit color codes  which are protected by a  12  8  3  hamming code  each base station has its own preassigned color code  so any incoming interfering signals from distant cells can be ignored  the modulation scheme for is54 is 7c4 differential quaternary phase shift keying  dqpsk   otherwise known differential 7t4 4psk or Ï€4 dqpsk  this technique allows a bit rate of 486 kbits with 30 khz channel spacing  to give a bandwidth efficiency of 162 bitshz  this value is 20  better than gsm  the major disadvantage with this type of linear modulation method is the power inefficiency  which translates into a heavier handheld portable and  even more inconvenient  a shorter time between battery recharges
