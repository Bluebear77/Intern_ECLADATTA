the evolution of   mobile communication   began in three different geographic regions    north america      europe   and   japan    the standards used in these regions were quite independent of each other    cndateapril 2017   the earliest mobile or wireless technologies implemented were wholly analogue  and are collectively known 1st generation    1g    technologies  in japan  the 1g standards were    nippon telegraph and telephone    ntt  and the high capacity version of it    hicap     the early systems used throughout europe were not compatible to each other  meaning the later idea of a common european union  viewpointtechnological standard was absent at this time    cndateapril 2017   the various 1g standards in use in europe included   cnetz    in germany and austria   comviq  in sweden     nordic mobile telephone   s450  nmt450  and nmt900  both in nordic countries   nmtf  french version of nmt900   tma450  spanish version of nmt450   radiocom 2000  rc2000   in france     total access communication systemtacs    total access communication system   in the   united kingdom      italy   and   republic of irelandireland     and tma900  spanish version of tacs   north american standards were   advanced mobile phone system    amps  and narrowband amps  namps   out of the 1g standards  the most successful was the amps system   citation neededdateapril 2007    despite the   nordic countries    cooperation  european engineering efforts were divided among the various standards  and the japanese standards did not get much attention   by whomdateapril 2017    developed by   bell labs   in the 1970s and first used commercially in the   united states   in 1983  amps operates in the 800   mhz   band in the united states and is the most widely distributed analog cellular standard   the 1900   mhz     personal communications servicepcs   band  established in 1994  is for digital operation only   the success of amps kickstarted the mobile age in the north america  the market showed an increasing demand because it had higher capacity and mobility than the thenexisting mobile communication standards were capable of handling  for example  the bell labs system in the 1970s could carry only 12 calls at a time throughout all of   new york city    amps used   frequency division multiple access    fdma  which enabled each cell site to transmit different frequencies  allowing many cell sites to be built near each other  amps also had many disadvantages  well  primarily  it did not have the ability to support the everincreasing demand for mobile communication usage  each cell site did not have much capacity for carrying higher numbers of calls  amps also had a poor security system which allowed people to steal a phone serial code to use for making illegal calls  all of these triggered the search for a more capable system  the quest resulted in is54  the first american 2g standard  in march 1990  the north american cellular network incorporated the is54b standard  the first north american dual mode digital cellular standard  this standard won over   motorola   narrowband amps or namps  an analog scheme which increased capacity  by cutting down voice channels from 30 khz to 10 khz  is54  the other hand  increased capacity by digital means using   timedivision multiple accesstdma   protocols  this method separates calls by time  placing parts of individual conversations the same frequency  one after the next  tdma tripled call capacity  using is54  a cellular carrier could convert any of its system   analogue electronicsanalog   voice channels to   digital datadigital    a dual mode phone uses digital channels where available  and defaults to regular amps where they are not  is54 was   backward compatible   with analogue cellular and indeed coexisted the same radio channels amps  no analogue customers were left behind  they simply could not access is54 new features  is54 also supported   authentication    a help in preventing fraud
