Title: Adoption

Value:
  japan   was one of the first countries to adopt 3g  the reason being the process of 3g spectrum allocation  which in japan was awarded without much upfront cost  the frequency spectrum was allocated in the us and europe based auctioning  thereby requiring a huge initial investment for any company wishing to provide 3g services  european companies collectively paid over 100 billion dollars in their spectrum auctions  ref    cite weburlhttps  wwwnaoorgukreportradiocommunicationsagencytheauctionofradiospectrumforthethirdgenerationofmobiletelephonestitleradiocommunications agency  the auction of radio spectrum for the third generation of mobile telephones  national audit office  nao  reportdate20011019websitenational audit officelanguageenusaccessdate20190817    ref    nepal telecom   adopted 3g service for the first time in southern   asia    however  its 3g was relatively slow to be adopted in   nepal    in some instances  3g networks do not use the same radio frequencies   2g    so mobile operators must build entirely new networks and license entirely new frequencies  especially to achieve high data transmission rates  other countries  delays were due to the expenses of upgrading transmission hardware  especially for   umts    whose deployment required the replacement of most broadcast towers  due to these issues and difficulties with deployment  many carriers could not or delayed the acquisition of these updated capabilities  in december 2007  190 3g networks were operating in 40 countries and 154   hsdpa   networks were operating in 71 countries  according to the global mobile suppliers association  gsa   in asia  europe  canada  and the us  telecommunication companies use   wcdma   technology with the support of around 100 terminal designs to operate 3g mobile networks  the rollout of 3g networks was delayed by the enormous costs of additional spectrum licensing fees in some countries  the license fees in some european countries were particularly high  bolstered by government auctions of a limited number of licenses and   sealed bid auction    and initial excitement over 3g potential  this led to a   telecoms crash   that ran concurrently with similar crashes in the   dark fibrefibreoptic   and   dotcom bubbledotcom   fields  the 3g standard is perhaps well known because of a massive expansion of the mobile communications market post2g and advances of the consumer mobile phone  an especially notable development during this time is the   smartphone    for example  the   iphone    and the   android  operating system  android   family   combining the abilities of a pda with a mobile phone  leading to widespread demand for mobile internet connectivity  3g has also introduced the term    mobile internetmobile broadband    because its speed and capability made it a viable alternative for internet browsing  and usb modems connecting to 3g networks  and now   4g   became increasingly common
