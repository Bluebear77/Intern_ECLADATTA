Title: Overview

Value:
several telecommunications companies marketed wireless mobile internet services 3g  indicating that the advertised service was provided over a 3g wireless network  however  3g services have largely been supplanted in marketing by 4g and 5g services in most areas of the world  services advertised 3g are required to meet   imt2000   technical standards  including standards for reliability and speed  data transfer rates   to meet the imt2000 standards  a system must provide peak data rates of at least 144 kbits  ref name  0    however  many services advertised 3g provide higher speed than the minimum technical requirements for a 3g service  ref    cite weburlhttps  kenstechtipscomindexphpdownloadspeeds2g3gand4gactualmeaningtitledownload speeds  comparing 2g  3g  4g  5g mobile

umts    universal mobile telecommunications system  system  standardized by 3gpp in 2001  was used in europe  japan    china    with a different radio interface  and other regions predominated by   gsm    global systems for mobile    2g   system infrastructure  the cell phones are typically umts and gsm hybrids  several radio interfaces are offered  sharing the same infrastructure    the original and most widespread radio interface is called   wcdma    wideband code division multiple access     the   tdscdma   radio interface was commercialized in 2009 and only offered in china    the latest umts release    hspa    can provide peak data rates up to 56 mbits in the downlink in theory  28 mbits in existing services  and 22 mbits in the uplink   the   cdma2000   system  first offered in 2002  standardized by   3gpp2    used especially in north america and south korea  sharing infrastructure with the   is95   2g standard  the cell phones are typically cdma2000 and is95 hybrids  the latest release   evdo   rev  b offers peak rates of 147 mbits downstream  the 3g systems and radio interfaces are based   spread spectrum   radio transmission technology  while the   enhanced data rates for gsm evolutiongsm edge   standard   29g      dect   cordless phones and   mobile wimax   standards formally also fulfill the imt2000 requirements and are approved 3g standards by itu  these are typically not branded 3g and are based completely different technologies  the common standards complying with the imt20003g standard are     edge    a revision by the   3gpp   organization to the older   2g     gsm   based transmission methods  which utilizes the same switching nodes  base station sites  and frequencies gprs  but includes a new base station and cellphone rf circuits  it is based the three times efficient   8psk   modulation scheme a supplement to the original   gmsk   modulation scheme  edge is still used extensively due to its ease of upgrade from existing 2g gsm infrastructure and cell phones      edge   combined with the   gprs   25g technology is called   egprs    and allows peak data rates in the order of 200 kbits  just like the original   umts   wcdma versions and thus formally fulfill the imt2000 requirements 3g systems  however  in practice  edge is seldom marketed a 3g system  but a   29g   system  edge shows slightly better   system spectral efficiency   than the original umts and   cdma2000   systems  but it is difficult to reach much higher peak data rates due to the limited gsm spectral bandwidth of 200 khz  and it is thus a dead end      edge   was also a mode in the   digital ampsis136   tdma system  no longer used      evolved edge    the latest revision  has peaks of 1 mbits downstream and 400 kbits upstream but is not commercially used   the universal mobile telecommunications system  created and revised by the   3gpp    the family is a full revision from gsm in terms of encoding methods and hardware  although some gsm sites can be   retrofitted   to broadcast in the umts   wcdma   format    wcdma is the most common deployment  commonly operated the 2100 mhz band  a few others use the 850  900  and 1900 mhz bands       high speed packet accesshspa   is an amalgamation of several upgrades to the original wcdma standard and offers speeds of 144 mbits down and 576 mbits up  hspa is backwardcompatible and uses the same frequencies wcdma       hspa    a further revision and upgrade of hspa  can provide theoretical peak data rates up to 168 mbits in the downlink and 22 mbits in the uplink  using a combination of air interface improvements well multicarrier hspa and   mimo    technically though  mimo and dchspa can be used without the    enhancements of hspa   the   cdma2000   system  or is2000  including cdma2000 1x and cdma2000 high rate packet data  or evdo   standardized by   3gpp2    differing from the 3gpp   evolving from the original is95 cdma system  is used especially in north america  china  india  pakistan  japan  south korea  southeast asia  europe  and africa    cdma2000 1x rev  e has an increased voice capacity  by three times the original amount  compared to rev  0   evdo   rev  b offers downstream peak rates of 147 mbits while rev  enhanced existing and new terminal user experience  while dect cordless phones and   mobile wimax   standards formally also fulfill the imt2000 requirements  they are not usually considered due to their rarity and unsuitability for usage with mobile phones  ref    cite weburlhttp  wwwhtccomwwwpressaspx  id76204
