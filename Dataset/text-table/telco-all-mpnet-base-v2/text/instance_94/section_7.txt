Title: Reduced Latency

Value:
with evolved edge come three major features designed to reduce latency over the air interface  in edge  a single rlc data block  ranging from 23 to 148 bytes of data  is transmitted over four frames  using a single time slot  average  this requires 20 ms for one way transmission  under the rtti scheme  one data block is transmitted over two frames in two timeslots  reducing the latency of the air interface to 10 ms  in addition  reduced latency also implies support of piggybacked   ack  tcp  ack      nack    pan   in which a bitmap of blocks not received is included in normal data blocks  using the pan field  the receiver may report missing data blocks immediately  rather than waiting to send a dedicated pan message  a final enhancement is rlcnon persistent mode  with edge  the rlc interface could operate in either acknowledged mode  or unacknowledged mode  in unacknowledged mode  there is no retransmission of missing data blocks  so a single corrupt block would cause an entire upperlayer ip packet to be lost  with nonpersistent mode  an rlc data block may be retransmitted if it is less than a certain age  once this time expires  it is considered lost  and subsequent data blocks may then be forwarded to upper layers
