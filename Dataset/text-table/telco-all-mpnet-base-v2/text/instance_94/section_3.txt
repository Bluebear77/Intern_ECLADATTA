Title: Transmission techniques

Value:
in addition to   gaussian minimumshift keying    gmsk   edge uses   phaseshift keying  higherorder pskhigherorder psk8 phaseshift keying    8psk  for the upper five of its nine modulation and coding schemes  edge produces a 3bit word for every change in carrier phase  this effectively triples the gross data rate offered by gsm  edge  like   gprs    uses a rate adaptation algorithm that adapts the modulation and coding scheme  mcs  according to the quality of the radio channel  and thus the bit rate and robustness of data transmission  it introduces a new technology not found in gprs    hybrid arqincremental redundancy    which  instead of retransmitting disturbed packets  sends more redundancy information to be combined in the receiver  this increases the probability of correct decoding  edge can carry a bandwidth up to 236 kbits  with endtoend latency of less than 150 ms  for 4   timeslot    theoretical maximum is 4736 kbits for 8 timeslots  in packet mode  this means it can handle four times much traffic standard gprs  edge meets the   international telecommunication union   requirement for a   3g   network  and has been accepted by the itu part of the   imt2000   family of 3g standards  ref name  ref1    it also enhances the circuit data mode called   hscsd    increasing the data rate of this service
