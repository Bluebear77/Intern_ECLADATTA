Title: EDGE modulation and coding scheme (MCS)

Value:
the channel encoding process in gprs well egprsedge consists of two steps  first  a cyclic code is used to add parity bits  which are also referred to the block check sequence  followed by coding with a possibly punctured   convolutional code     ref namets45001    cite web urlhttp  www3gpporgftpspecshtmlinfo45001htm title3ggp ts45001  technical specification group gsmedge radio access network  physical layer the radio path  general description author3rd generation partnership project dateseptember 2012 accessdate20130720    ref  in gprs  the coding schemes cs1 to cs4 specify the number of parity bits generated by the cyclic code and the puncturing rate of the convolutional code  ref namets45001  in gprs coding schemes cs1 through cs3  the convolutional code is of rate 12  ie  each input bit is converted into two coded bits  ref namets45001  in coding schemes cs2 and cs3  the output of the convolutional code is   punctured codepunctured   to achieve the desired code rate  ref namets45001  in gprs coding scheme cs4  no convolutional coding is applied  ref namets45001  in egprsedge  the   modulation  disambiguation  modulation   and coding schemes mcs1 to mcs9 take the place of the coding schemes of gprs  and additionally specify which modulation scheme is used  gmsk or 8psk  ref namets45001  mcs1 through mcs4 use gmsk and have performance similar  but not equal  to gprs  while mcs5 through mcs9 use 8psk  ref namets45001  in all egprs modulation and coding schemes  a convolutional code of rate 13 is used  and puncturing is used to achieve the desired code rate  ref namets45001  in contrast to gprs  the   radio link control    rlc  and   media access control    mac  headers and the payload data are coded separately in egprs  ref namets45001  the headers are coded more robustly than the data  ref namets45001    clearboth     notelist
