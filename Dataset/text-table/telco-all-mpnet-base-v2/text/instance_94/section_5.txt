Title: Evolved EDGE

Value:
evolved edge  also called edge evolution and 2875g  is a bolton extension to the   gsm   mobile telephony standard  which improves edge in a number of ways  latencies are reduced by lowering the   transmission time interval   by half  from 20 ms to 10 ms   bit rates are increased up to 1 mbits peak bandwidth and latencies down to 80 ms using dual carrier  higher symbol rate and   higherorder modulation    32qam and 16qam instead of 8psk   and   turbo code   to improve error correction  this results in real world downlink speeds of up to 600kbits  ref    cite web urlhttp  developerattcomdevcentraltools_technologiesnetworkdocsdatacapabilities_gprs__to_hsdpapdf titleedge  hspa and lte  the mobile broadband advantage publisherrysavy research and 3g americas pages5865 date20070901 accessdate20100927 urlstatusdead archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20091007091901http  developerattcomdevcentraltools_technologiesnetworkdocsdatacapabilities_gprs__to_hsdpapdf archivedate20091007    ref  further the signal quality is improved using dual antennas improving average bitrates and spectrum efficiency  the main intention of increasing the existing edge throughput is that many operators would like to upgrade their existing infrastructure rather than invest new network infrastructure  mobile operators have invested billions in gsm networks  many of which are already capable of supporting edge data speeds up to 2368 kbits  with a software upgrade and a new device compliant with evolved edge  like an evolved edge   smartphone    for the user  these data rates can be boosted to speeds approaching 1 mbits  ie  986 kbits per timeslot for 32qam   many service providers may not invest in a completely new technology like   3g   networks  ref name  engadgetmobilecom     cite weburlhttp  wwwengadgetmobilecom20090914nokiasiemensfiresofffirstedgeevolutiondownlinkdualcarriertitleyahoo  websitewwwengadgetmobilecomaccessdate20160314archivedate20181117archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20181117151434http  wwwengadgetmobilecom20090914nokiasiemensfiresofffirstedgeevolutiondownlinkdualcarrierurlstatusdead    ref  considerable research and development happened throughout the world for this new technology  a successful trial by nokia siemens and  one of china leading operators  has been achieved in a live environment  ref name  engadgetmobilecom    with the introduction for more advanced wireless technologies like umts and lte  which also focus a network coverage layer low frequencies and the upcoming phaseout and shutdown of   2g   mobile networks  it is very unlikely that evolved edge will ever see any deployment live networks  up to now  of 2016  there are no   wireless networkcommercial networks   which support the evolved edge standard  3gpp rel7
