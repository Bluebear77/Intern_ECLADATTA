Value:
  mainwireless telegraphy   a number of wireless electrical signaling schemes including sending electric currents through water and the ground using electrostatic and   electromagnetic induction   were investigated for telegraphy in the late 19th century before practical radio systems became available  these included a patented induction system by   thomas edison   allowing a telegraph a running train to connect with telegraph wires running parallel to the tracks  a   william preece   induction telegraph system for sending messages across bodies of water  and several operational and proposed telegraphy and voice earth conduction systems  the edison system was used by stranded trains during the   great blizzard of 1888   and earth conductive systems found limited use between trenches during   world war i   but these systems were never successful economically
