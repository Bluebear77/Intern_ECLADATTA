  mainradio communicationradio communication service     furthermicrowave transmission   radio and   microwave   communication carry information by   modulationmodulating   properties of   electromagnetic waves   transmitted through space  specifically  the transmitter generates artificial electromagnetic waves by applying timevarying   electric currents   to its   antenna  radio  antenna    the waves travel away from the antenna until they eventually reach the antenna of a receiver  which induces an electric current in the receiving antenna  this current can be detected and   modulationdemodulated   to recreate the information sent by the transmitter
