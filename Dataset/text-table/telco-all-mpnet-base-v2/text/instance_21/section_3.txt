Title: Description

Value:
the mobile switching center  msc  is the primary service delivery node for gsmcdma  responsible for   routing in the pstnrouting   voice calls and sms well other services  such conference calls  fax  and circuitswitched data   the msc sets up and releases the endtoend connection  handles mobility and handover requirements during the call and takes care of charging and realtime prepaid account monitoring  in the gsm mobile phone system  in contrast with earlier analogue services  fax and data information is sent digitally encoded directly to the msc  only at the msc is this recoded into an  analogue  signal  although actually this will almost certainly mean sound is encoded digitally a   pulsecode modulation    pcm  signal in a 64kbits timeslot  known a   ds0   in america   there are various different names for mscs in different contexts which reflects their complex role in the network  all of these terms though could refer to the same msc  but doing different things at different times  the gateway msc  gmsc  is the msc that determines which  visited msc   vmsc  the subscriber who is being called is currently located at  it also interfaces with the pstn  all mobile to mobile calls and pstn to mobile calls are routed through a gmsc  the term is only valid in the context of one call  since any msc may provide both the gateway function and the visited msc function  however  some manufacturers design dedicated high capacity mscs which do not have any   base station subsystem    bss  connected to them  these mscs will then be the gateway msc for many of the calls they handle  the visited msc  vmsc  is the msc where a customer is currently located  the   network_switching_subsystem  visitor_location_register_  vlr  visitor location register    vlr  associated with this msc will have the subscriber data in it  the anchor msc is the msc from which a   handover   has been initiated  the target msc is the msc toward which a handover should take place  a   mobile switching center server   is a part of the redesigned msc concept starting from   3gpp  standards3gpp release 4
