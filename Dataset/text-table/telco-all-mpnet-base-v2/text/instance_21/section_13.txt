Title: Procedures implemented

Value:
the auc stores the following data for each imsi   the k  sub  i  sub   algorithm id   the standard algorithms are called a3 or a8  but an operator may choose a proprietary one   when the msc asks the auc for a new set of triplets for a particular imsi  the auc first generates a random number known rand  this rand is then combined with the k  sub  i  sub  to produce two numbers follows   the k  sub  i  sub  and rand are fed into the a3 algorithm and the signed response  sres  is calculated   the k  sub  i  sub  and rand are fed into the a8 algorithm and a session key called k  sub   sub  is calculated  the numbers  rand  sres  k  sub   sub   form the triplet sent back to the msc  when a particular imsi requests access to the gsm core network  the msc sends the rand part of the triplet to the sim  the sim then feeds this number and the k  sub  i  sub   which is burned onto the sim  into the a3 algorithm appropriate and an sres is calculated and sent back to the msc  if this sres matches with the sres in the triplet  which it should if it is a valid sim   then the mobile is allowed to attach and proceed with gsm services  after successful authentication  the msc sends the encryption key k  sub   sub  to the   base station subsystem  base station controllerbase station controller    bsc  so that all communications can be encrypted and decrypted  of course  the mobile phone can generate the k  sub   sub  itself by feeding the same rand supplied during authentication and the k  sub  i  sub  into the a8 algorithm  the auc is usually collocated with the hlr  although this is not necessary  whilst the procedure is secure for most everyday use  it is by no means hack proof  therefore  a new set of security methods was designed for 3g phones  in practice  a3 and a8 algorithms are generally implemented together  known a3a8  see   comp128     an a3a8 algorithm is implemented in subscriber identity module  sim  cards and in gsm network authentication centers  it is used to authenticate the customer and generate a key for encrypting voice and data traffic  defined in 3gpp ts 43020  0320 before rel4   development of a3 and a8 algorithms is considered a matter for individual gsm network operators  although example implementations are available  to encrypt global system for mobile communications  gsm  cellular communications a5 algorithm is used  ref    cite book  title  a comprehensive guide to 5g security  publisher  john wiley  sons ltd   first1  shahria  last1  shahabuddin  first2  sadiqur  last2  rahaman  first3  faisal  last3  rehman  first4  ijaz  last4  ahmad  first5  zaheer  last5  khan  year  2018  page  12    ref  visitor location register  vlr
