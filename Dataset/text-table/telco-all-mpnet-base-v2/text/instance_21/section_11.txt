Title: Description

Value:
the authentication center  auc  is a function to   authenticationauthenticate   each   sim card   that attempts to connect to the gsm core network  typically when the phone is powered   once the authentication is successful  the hlr is allowed to manage the sim and services described above  an   encryption key   is also generated that is subsequently used to encrypt all wireless communications  voice  sms  etc  between the mobile phone and the gsm core network  if the authentication fails  then no services are possible from that particular combination of sim card and mobile phone operator attempted  there is an additional form of identification check performed the serial number of the mobile phone described in the eir section below  but this is not relevant to the auc processing  proper implementation of security in and around the auc is a key part of an operator strategy to avoid   sim cloning    the auc does not engage directly in the authentication process  but instead generates data known triplets for the msc to use during the procedure  the security of the process depends upon a   shared secret   between the auc and the sim called the k  sub  i  sub   the k  sub  i  sub  is securely burned into the sim during manufacture and is also securely replicated onto the auc  this k  sub  i  sub  is never transmitted between the auc and sim  but is combined with the imsi to produce a   challengeresponse authenticationchallengeresponse   for identification purposes and an encryption key called k  sub   sub  for use in over the air communications
