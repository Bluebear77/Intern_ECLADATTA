Title: Equipment identity register (EIR)

Value:
eir is a system that handles realtime requests to check the   international mobile equipment identityimei    checkimei  of mobile devices that come from the switching equipment  msc    sgsn      mobility management entitymme     the answer contains the result of the check   whitelisted  the device is allowed to register the network   blacklisted  the device is prohibited from registering the network   greylisted  the device is allowed to register the network temporarily   an error  unknown equipment  may also be returned  the switching equipment must use the eir response to determine whether or not to allow the device to register or reregister the network  since the response of switching equipment to  greylisted  and  unknown equipment  responses is not clearly described in the standard  they are most often not used  most often  eir uses the imei blacklist feature  which contains the imei of the devices that need to be banned from the network  a rule  these are stolen or lost devices  mobile operators rarely use eir capabilities to block devices their own  usually blocking begins when there is a law in the country  which obliges all cellular operators of the country to do so  therefore  in the delivery of the basic components of the network switching subsystem  core network  is often already present eir with basic functionality  which includes a  whitelisted  response to all checkimei and the ability to fill imei blacklist  which will be given a  blacklisted  response  when the legislative framework for blocking registration of devices in cellular networks appears in the country  the telecommunications regulator usually has a central eir    central equipment identity registerceir    system  which is integrated with the eir of all operators and transmits to them the actual lists of identifiers that must be used when processing checkimei requests  in doing so  there may be many new requirements for eir systems that are not present in the legacy eir   synchronizing lists with ceir  ceir systems are not described by a standard  so the protocols and exchange mode may differ from country to country   supporting additional lists  imei white list  imei grey list  list of allocated   type allocation codetacs    etc  support in lists not only imei but also bindings  imeiimsi  imeimsisdn  imei   international mobile subscriber identityimsi      msisdn     supporting the customized logic of lists applying   automatic adding the item to a list in separate scenarios   sending   sms   notifications to subscribers in separate scenarios   integration with the billing system to receive imsimsisdn bundles   accumulating the subscribers  profiles  history of device changing    longterm storage of processing of all checkimei requests  other functions may be required in individual cases  for example  kazakhstan has introduced mandatory registration of devices and their binding to subscribers  but when a subscriber appears in the network with a new device  the network operation is not blocked completely  and the subscriber is allowed to register the device  to do this  there are blocked all services  except the following  calls to a specific service number  sending sms to a specific service number  and all internet traffic is redirected to a specific landing page  this is achieved by the fact that eir can send commands to several mno systems  hlr    policy and charging rules functionpcrf      short message service centersmsc    etc   the most common suppliers of individual eir systems  not part of a complex solution  are the companies broadforward  mahindra comviva  mavenir  nokia  svyazcom
