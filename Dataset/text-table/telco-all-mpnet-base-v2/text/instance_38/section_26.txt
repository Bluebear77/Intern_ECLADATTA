  mainmobile phone radiation and health     see alsonomophobiamobile phone overuse   the effect of mobile phone radiation human health is the subject of recent   whendateoctober 2017   interest and study  a result of the enormous increase in mobile phone usage throughout the world  mobile phones use   electromagnetic radiation   in the   microwave   range  which some believe may be harmful to human health  a large body of research exists  both   epidemiologyepidemiological   and experimental  in   animal modelnonhuman animals   and in humans  the majority of this research shows no definite causative relationship between exposure to mobile phones and harmful biological effects in humans  this is often paraphrased simply the balance of evidence showing no harm to humans from mobile phones  although a significant number of individual studies do suggest such a relationship  or are inconclusive  other   wireless electronic devices and healthdigital wireless systems    such data communication networks  produce similar radiation    citation neededdatefebruary 2018   31 may 2011  the   world health organization   stated that mobile phone use may possibly represent a longterm
