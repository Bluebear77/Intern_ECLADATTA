Title: Central processing unit

Value:
mobile phones have   central processing unit    cpus   similar to those in computers  but optimised to operate in low power environments  mobile cpu performance depends not only the clock rate  generally given in multiples of   hertz     ref    cite web  title  cpu frequency  work  cpu world glossary  publisher  cpu world  date  25 march 2008  url  http  wwwcpuworldcomglossaryccpu_frequencyhtml  accessdate 1 january 2010    ref  but also the   memory hierarchy   also greatly affects overall performance  because of these problems  the performance of mobile phone cpus is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications
