  short descriptionsmall  lowpower cellular base station   in   telecommunications    a femtocell is a small  lowpower   cellular base station    typically designed for use in a home or small business  a broader term which is more widespread in the industry is   small cell    with femtocell a subset  it connects to the service provider network via broadband  such   digital subscriber linedsl   or   cable televisioncable     current designs typically support four to eight simultaneously active mobile phones in a residential setting depending version number and femtocell hardware  and eight to sixteen mobile phones in enterprise settings  a femtocell allows service providers to extend service coverage indoors or at the cell edge  especially where access would otherwise be limited or unavailable  although much attention is focused   wcdmawcdma    the concept is applicable to all standards  including   gsm      cdma2000      tdscdma      wimax   and   lte  telecommunication  lte   solutions    file  femtocellsjpgthumbrightverizon and at  femtocell access points   the use of femtocells allows network coverage in places where the signal to the main network cells might be too weak  furthermore  femtocells lower contention the main network cells  by forming a connection from the end user  through an internet connection  to the operator private network infrastructure elsewhere  the lowering of contention to the main cells plays a part in   cell breathing  telephony  breathing    where connections are offloaded based physical distance to cell towers  consumers and small businesses benefit from greatly improved coverage and signal strength since they have a facto base station inside their premises  a result of being relatively close to the femtocell  the mobile phone  user equipment  expends significantly less power for communication with it  thus increasing battery life  they may also get better voice quality  via   wideband audiohd voice    depending a number of factors such operatornetwork support  customer contractprice plan  phone and operating system support  some carriers may also offer more attractive tariffs  for example discounted calls from home  femtocells are an alternative way to deliver the benefits of   fixedmobile convergence    fmc   the distinction is that most fmc architectures require a new dualmode handset which works with existing unlicensed spectrum homeenterprise   wireless access point    while a femtocellbased deployment will work with existing handsets but requires the installation of a new access point that uses licensed spectrum  many operators worldwide offer a femtocell service  mainly targeted at businesses but also offered to individual customers  often for a oneoff fee  when they complain to the operator regarding a poor or nonexistent signal at their location  operators who have launched a femtocell service include   sfr      at       spire wirelessc spire      sprint nextel      verizon      zain groupzain      mobile telesystems      tmobile us      orange saorange      vodafone      ee limitedee      o2  uk  o2      hutchison 3gthree    and others  in   3gpp   terminology  a   home nodeb    hnb  is a 3g femtocell  a   home enodeb    henb  is an   lte  telecommunication  lte 4g   femtocell  theoretically the range of a   gsm  base station subsystemstandard base station   may be up to 35 kilometres  22 mi   and in practice could be 510 km  36 mi   a   microcell   is less than two kilometers  1 mile  wide  a   picocell   is 200 meters  yards  or less  and a femtocell is in the order of 10 meters  yards    ref    cite web authordimitris mavrakis urlhttp  wwwvisionmobilecomblog200712dowereallyneedfemtocells titledo we really need femto cells  publishervisionmobile date20071201 accessdate20120726 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20110416235037http  wwwvisionmobilecomblog200712dowereallyneedfemtocells archivedate20110416 urlstatusdead    ref  although at  calls its product  with a range of   convert40ftm    a  microcell    ref    cite web urlhttp  wwwwirelessattcomlearnwhy3gmicrocellfaqjsp titleat  3g microcell  wireless signal booster publisherwireless from at  accessdate20120726 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20100221133651http  wwwwirelessattcomlearnwhy3gmicrocellfaqjsp archivedate20100221 urlstatusdead    ref  at  uses  at  3g microcell  a trademark and not necessarily the  microcell  technology  however  ref    cite web urlhttp  wwwwirelessattcomlearnwhy3gmicrocellfaqjsp titleat  3g microcell  wireless signal booster  wireless from at  publisherwirelessattcom accessdate20140317 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20100221133651http  wwwwirelessattcomlearnwhy3gmicrocellfaqjsp archivedate20100221 urlstatusdead    ref
