Title: Spectrum accuracy

Value:
to meet   federal communications commission    fcc     ofcom     spectral maskspectrum mask   requirements  femtocells must generate the   radio frequency   signal with a high degree of precision  to do this over a long period of time is a major technical challenge  the solution to this problem is to use an external  accurate signal to constantly calibrate the oscillator to ensure it maintains its accuracy  this is not simple  broadband backhaul introduces issues of network jitterwander and recovered clock accuracy   but technologies such the   ieee 1588   time synchronisation standard may address the issue  also    network time protocol    ntp  is being pursued by some developers a possible solution to provide frequency stability  conventional  macrocell  base stations often use gps timing for synchronization and this could be used   ref name  hands with the samsung ubicell    although there are concerns cost and the difficulty of ensuring good gps coverage  standards bodies have recognized the challenge of this and the implications device cost  for example  3gpp has relaxed the 50ppb   parts per billion   precision to 100ppb for indoor base stations in release 6 and a further loosening to 250ppb for home node b in release 8
