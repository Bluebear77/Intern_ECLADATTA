Title: Interference

Value:
the placement of a femtocell has a critical effect the performance of the wider network  and this is the key issue to be addressed for successful deployment  because femtocells can use the same frequency bands the conventional cellular network  there has been the worry that rather than improving the situation they could potentially cause problems  femtocells incorporate interference mitigation techniquesdetecting macrocells  adjusting power  ref  x  kang al   pricebased resource allocation for spectrumsharing femtocell networks  a stackelberg game approach  in ieee journal selected areas in communications  vol  30  no  3  pp  538549  apr  2012  ref  and scrambling codes accordingly  ralph vega  at  president  reported in june 2011 they recommended against using femtocells where signal strength was middle or strong because of interference problems they discovered after widescale deployment  ref  vega  ralph  all things video interview 38 minutes in  june 24  2011  accessed june 28  2011  ref  this differs from previous opinions expressed by at  and others  a good example is the comments made by gordon mansfield  executive director of ran delivery  at   speaking at the femtozone at ctia march 2010   blockquote  we have deployed femtocells cocarrier with both the hopping channels for gsm macrocells and with umts macrocells  interference is nt a problem  we have tested femtocells extensively in real customer deployments of many thousands of femtocells  and we find that the mitigation techniques implemented successfully minimise and avoid interference  the more femtocells you deploy  the more uplink interference is reduced   blockquote  the femto forum has some extensive reports this subject  which have been produced together with 3gpp and 3gpp2  ref  interference management in umts femtocells  complete paper   webarchiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20090804082632http  wwwfemtoforumorgfemtoindexphp  id69 date20090804    february 2010  ref   ref  interference management in umts femtocells  summary paper   webarchiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20090804082632http  wwwfemtoforumorgfemtoindexphp  id69 date20090804    february 2010  ref  to quote from the summary paper  summary of findings   blockquote  the simulations performed in the femto forum wg2 and 3gpp ran4 encompass a wide spectrum of possible deployment scenarios including shared channel and dedicated channel deployments  in addition  the studies looked at the impact in different morphologies  well in closed versus open access  the following are broad conclusions from the studies  1  when femtocells are used in areas of poor or no coverage  macrofemto interference is unlikely to be a problem  2  if the femto network is sharing the channel  cochannel  with the macro network  interference can occur  however  if the interference management techniques advocated by the femto forum are adopted  the resulting interference can be mitigated in most cases  3  a femtocell network deployed an adjacent dedicated channel is unlikely to create interference to a macro network  additionally  the impact of a macro network the performance of a femtocell an adjacent channel is limited to isolated cases  if the interference mitigation techniques advocated by the femto forum are used  the impact is further marginalised  4  closed access represents the worstcase scenario for creation of interference  open access reduces the chances of user equipment  mobile phone handsets  3g data dongles  etc  the macro network interfering with a proximate femtocell  5  the same conclusions were reached for both the 850 mhz  3gpp band 17  and 2100 mhz  3gpp band 1  deployments that were studied  the conclusions are common to the 850 mhz and 2100 mhz bands that were simulated in the studies  and can be extrapolated to other mobile bands  with interference mitigation techniques successfully implemented  simulations show that femtocell deployments can enable very high capacity networks by providing between a 10 and 100 times increase in capacity with minimal deadzone impact and acceptable noise rise  femtocells can also create a much better user experience by enabling substantially higher data rates than can be obtained with a macro network and net throughputs that will be ultimately limited by backhaul in most cases  over 20 mbps in 5 mhz    blockquote
