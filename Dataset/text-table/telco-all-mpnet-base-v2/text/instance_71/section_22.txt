Title: Frequency range 2 (24â€“71 GHz)

Value:
the minimum channel bandwidth defined for fr2 is 50 mhz and the maximum is 400 mhz  with twochannel aggregation supported in 3gpp release 15  signals in this frequency range with wavelengths between 4 and 12 mm are called millimeter waves  the higher the carrier frequency  the greater the ability to support high datatransfer speeds  this is because a given channel bandwidth takes up a lower fraction of the carrier frequency  so highbandwidth channels are easier to realize at higher carrier frequencies
