Title: Latency

Value:
in 5g  the ideal  air latency  is of the order of 8 to 12 milliseconds ie  excluding delays due to   harq   retransmissions  handovers  etc retransmission latency and backhaul latency to the server must be added to the  air latency  for correct comparisons  verizon reported the latency its 5g early deployment is 30 ms   citation neededdatemay 2023    edge servers close to the towers can probably reduce latency to between 10 and 15 milliseconds   citation neededdatemay 2023    latency is much higher during handovers  ranging from 50 to 500 milliseconds depending the type of handover  reducing handover interruption time is an ongoing area of research and development  options include modifying the handover margin  offset  and the timetotrigger  ttt
