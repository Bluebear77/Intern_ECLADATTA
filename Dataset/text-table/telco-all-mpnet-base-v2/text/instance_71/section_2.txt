5g networks are   cellular network    in which the service area is divided into small geographical areas called cells  all 5g wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a   cellular base station   via fixed   antenna  radio  antenna    over frequencies assigned by the base station  the base stations  termed   node  networking  node    are connected to switching centers in the   public switched telephone networktelephone network   and routers for   internet access   by highbandwidth   optical fiber   or wireless   backhaul  telecommunications  backhaul connections    in other

partnership project    3gpp   defines  5g  any system using   5g nr    5g new radio  software  a definition that came into general use by late 2018  several network operators use   millimeter wave   called   5g nr frequency bands  frequency range 2fr2   in 5g terminology  for additional capacity and higher throughputs  millimeter waves have a shorter range than the lower frequency   microwave    therefore the cells are of a smaller size  millimeter waves also have more trouble passing through building walls and humans  millimeterwave antennas are smaller than the large antennas used in previous cellular networks  the increased data rate is achieved partly by using additional higherfrequency radio waves in addition to the low and mediumband frequencies used in previous cellular networks  for providing a wide range of services  5g networks can operate in three frequency bands  low  medium  and high  5g can be implemented in lowband  midband or highband millimeterwave  lowband 5g uses a similar frequency range to 4g cellphones  600900   megahertzmhz    which can potentially offer higher download speeds than 4g  5250   megabits per second    mbits    ref name  horwitz

similar to 4g towers  midband 5g uses   microwaves   of 1747   gigahertzghz    allowing speeds of 100900 mbits  with each cell tower providing service up to several kilometers in radius  this level of service is the most widely deployed  and was deployed in many metropolitan areas in 2020  some regions are not implementing the low band  making midband the minimum service level  highband 5g uses frequencies of 2447 ghz  near the bottom of the millimeter wave band  although higher frequencies may be used in the future  it often achieves download speeds in the   gigabits per
