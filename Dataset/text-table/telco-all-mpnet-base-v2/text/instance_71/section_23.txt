Title: FR2 coverage

Value:
5g in the 24 ghz range or above use higher frequencies than 4g  and a result  some 5g signals are not capable of traveling large distances  over a few hundred meters   unlike 4g or lower frequency 5g signals  sub 6 ghz   this requires placing 5g base stations every few hundred meters in order to use higher frequency bands  also  these higher frequency 5g signals can not penetrate solid objects easily  such cars  trees  walls  and even humans  because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves  5g cells can be deliberately designed to be inconspicuous possible  which finds applications in places like restaurants and shopping malls  ref    cite weburlhttp  wwwrfwirelessworldcomterminology5gspeedvs5grangehtmltitle5g speed vs 5g rangewhat is the value of 5g speed5g rangewebsiterfwirelessworldcomaccessdateapril 21  2019archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20190421224510http  wwwrfwirelessworldcomterminology5gspeedvs5grangehtmlarchivedateapril 21  2019urlstatuslive    ref
