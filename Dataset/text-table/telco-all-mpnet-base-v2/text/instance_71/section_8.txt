Title: Range

Value:
the range of 5g depends many factors  transmit power  frequency  and interference  for example  mmwave  eg   band n258  will have a lower range than midband  eg   band n78  which will have a lower range than lowband  eg   band n5  given the marketing hype what 5g can offer    network simulationsimulators   and   drive testingdrive tests   are used by cellular service providers for the precise measurement of 5g performance
