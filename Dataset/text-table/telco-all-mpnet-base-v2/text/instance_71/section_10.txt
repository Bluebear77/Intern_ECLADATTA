Title: Fronthaul network

Value:
  ieee   covers several areas of 5g with a core focus in wireline sections between the remote radio head  rrh  and base band unit  bbu   the 19141 standards focus network architecture and dividing the connection between the rru and bbu into two key sections  radio unit  ru  to the distributor unit   being the ngfii  next generation fronthaul interface  and the to the central unit  cu  being the ngfiii interface allowing a more diverse and costeffective network  ngfii and ngfiii have defined performance values which should be compiled to ensure different traffic types defined by the itu are capable of being carried    page neededdatejanuary 2022   the ieee 19143 standard is creating a new ethernet frame format capable of carrying   quadrature amplitude modulationiq   data in a much more efficient way depending the functional split utilized  this is based the   3gpp   definition of functional splits    page neededdatejanuary 2022
