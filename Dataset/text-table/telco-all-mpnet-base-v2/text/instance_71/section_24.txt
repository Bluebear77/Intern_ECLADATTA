Title: Massive MIMO

Value:
  see alsomultiuser mimo   mimo systems use multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver ends of a wireless communication system  multiple antennas use the spatial dimension for multiplexing in addition to the time and frequency ones  without changing the bandwidth requirements of the system  massive mimo  multipleinput and multipleoutput    antenna  radio  antennas   increases sector throughput and capacity density using large numbers of antennas  this includes single user mimo and   multiuser mimo    mumimo     citation needed spandatejanuary 2022each antenna is individuallycontrolled and may embed radio transceiver components    in general  more antennas equal better performance  but more antennas also require bigger arrays that draw more power  some of the places service providers deploy radio links have very tight constraints  so finding the right solution means weighing tradeoffs  for inbuilding coverage  the performance gain is often worth it  for outdoor or streetlevel coverage  maybe not  ref    cite web urlhttps  wwwinfovistacomblogmassivemimo5gdeployments titletop five considerations for massive mimo 5g deployments accessdatedecember 6  2022 archivedatedecember 6  2022 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20221206151920https  wwwinfovistacomblogmassivemimo5gdeployments urlstatuslive    ref
