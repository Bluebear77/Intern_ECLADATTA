Title: Convergence of Wi-Fi and cellular

Value:
one expected benefit of the transition to 5g is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost  power  and complexity reductions  lte has targeted convergence with   wifi   bandtechnology via various efforts  such   license assisted access    laa  5g signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by wifi  and   ltewlan aggregation    lwa  convergence with wifi radio   but the differing capabilities of cellular and wifi have limited the scope of convergence  however  significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5g  combined with migration from distributed   radio access networkradio access network    dran  to cloud or centralizedran    cran    and rollout of cellular   small cell   can potentially narrow the gap between wifi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments  radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and wifi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies  ref    cite weburlhttps  wwwsolwisecoukarticle5gtitlearticle  5g  solwise ltdwebsitewwwsolwisecoukaccessdatedecember 18  2022archivedatemay 16  2022archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20220516153358https  wwwsolwisecoukarticle5gurlstatuslive    ref
