Title: Error rate

Value:
5g uses adaptive modulation and coding scheme  mcs  to keep the block error rate  bler  extremely low  whenever the error rate crosses a  very low  threshold the transmitter will switch to a lower mcs  which will be less errorprone  this way speed is sacrificed to ensure an almost zero error rate
