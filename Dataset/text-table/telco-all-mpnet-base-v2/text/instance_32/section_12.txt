Title: Flexible allocation of resources

Value:
asynchronous cdma offers a key advantage in the flexible allocation of resources ie  allocation of spreading sequences to active users  in the case of cdm  synchronous cdma   tdma  and fdma the number of simultaneous orthogonal codes  time slots  and frequency slots respectively are fixed  hence the capacity in terms of the number of simultaneous users is limited  there are a fixed number of orthogonal codes  time slots or frequency bands that can be allocated for cdm  tdma  and fdma systems  which remain underutilized due to the bursty nature of telephony and packetized data transmissions  there is no strict limit to the number of users that can be supported in an asynchronous cdma system  only a practical limit governed by the desired bit error probability since the sir  signaltointerference ratio  varies inversely with the number of users  in a bursty traffic environment like mobile telephony  the advantage afforded by asynchronous cdma is that the performance  bit error rate  is allowed to fluctuate randomly  with an average value determined by the number of users times the percentage of utilization  suppose there are 2n users that only talk half of the time  then 2n users can be accommodated with the same average bit error probability users that talk all of the time  the key difference here is that the bit error probability for users talking all of the time is constant  whereas it is a random quantity  with the same mean  for 2n users talking half of the time  in other words  asynchronous cdma is ideally suited to a mobile network where large numbers of transmitters each generate a relatively small amount of traffic at irregular intervals  cdm  synchronous cdma   tdma  and fdma systems can not recover the underutilized resources inherent to bursty traffic due to the fixed number of   orthogonal   codes  time slots or frequency channels that can be assigned to individual transmitters  for instance  if there are time slots in a tdma system and 2n users that talk half of the time  then half of the time there will be more than users needing to use more than time slots  furthermore  it would require significant overhead to continually allocate and deallocate the orthogonalcode  timeslot or frequencychannel resources  by comparison  asynchronous cdma transmitters simply send when they have something to say and go off the air when they do not  keeping the same signature sequence long they are connected to the system
