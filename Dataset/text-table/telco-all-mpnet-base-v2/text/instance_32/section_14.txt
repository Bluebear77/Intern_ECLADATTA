Title: Collaborative CDMA

Value:
a novel collaborative multiuser transmission and detection scheme called collaborative cdma  ref    cite news  first  indu   last  shakya  year  2011  title  high user capacity collaborative cdma  publisher  iet communications    ref  has been investigated for the uplink that exploits the differences between users  fading channel signatures to increase the user capacity well beyond the spreading length in the mailimited environment  the authors show that it is possible to achieve this increase at a low complexity and high   bit error rate   performance in flat fading channels  which is a major research challenge for overloaded cdma systems  in this approach  instead of using one sequence per user in conventional cdma  the authors group a small number of users to share the same spreading sequence and enable group spreading and despreading operations  the new collaborative multiuser receiver consists of two stages  group multiuser detection  mud  stage to suppress the mai between the groups and a lowcomplexity maximumlikelihood detection stage to recover jointly the cospread users  data using minimal euclideandistance measure and users  channelgain coefficients  an enhanced cdma version known interleavedivision multiple access  idma  uses the orthogonal interleaving the only means of user separation in place of signature sequence used in cdma system
