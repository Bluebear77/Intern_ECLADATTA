Title: Steps in CDMA modulation

Value:
cdma is a spreadspectrum multipleaccess technique  a spreadspectrum technique spreads the bandwidth of the data uniformly for the same transmitted power  a spreading code is a pseudorandom code that has a narrow   ambiguity function    unlike other narrow pulse codes  in cdma a locally generated code runs at a much higher rate than the data to be transmitted  data for transmission is combined by bitwise   xor  bitwise operationxor    exclusive or  with the faster code  the figure shows how a spreadspectrum signal is generated  the data signal with pulse duration of  math  t_b  math   symbol period  is xored with the code signal with pulse duration of  math  t_c  math   chip period    note    bandwidth  signal processing  bandwidth   is proportional to  math  1t  math   where  math   math   bit time   therefore  the bandwidth of the data signal is  math  1t_b  math  and the bandwidth of the spread spectrum signal is  math  1t_c  math   since  math  t_c  math  is much smaller than  math  t_b  math   the bandwidth of the spreadspectrum signal is much larger than the bandwidth of the original signal  the ratio  math  t_bt_c  math  is called the spreading factor or processing gain and determines to a certain extent the upper limit of the total number of users supported simultaneously by a base station  ref name  ref 1     ref name  ref 2      file  generation of cdmasvgthumb500pxcentergeneration of a cdma signal   each user in a cdma system uses a different code to modulate their signal  choosing the codes used to modulate the signal is very important in the performance of cdma systems  the best performance occurs when there is good separation between the signal of a desired user and the signals of other users  the separation of the signals is made by   crosscorrelationcorrelating   the received signal with the locally generated code of the desired user  if the signal matches the desired user code  then the correlation function will be high and the system can extract that signal  if the desired user code has nothing in common with the signal  the correlation should be close to zero possible  thus eliminating the signal   this is referred to   crosscorrelation    if the code is correlated with the signal at any time offset other than zero  the correlation should be close to zero possible  this is referred to autocorrelation and is used to reject multipath interference  ref name  ref 3     cite book title digital communications  fundamentals and applications  2nd ed year2014last1sklarfirst1bernardlast2rayfirst2pabitra k    ref   ref name  ref 4     cite book titlewireless communications  2nd ed year2010last1molischfirst1andreas    ref  an analogy to the problem of multiple access is a room  channel  in which people wish to talk to each other simultaneously  to avoid confusion  people could take turns speaking  time division   speak at different pitches  frequency division   or speak in different languages  code division   cdma is analogous to the last example where people speaking the same language can understand each other  but other languages are perceived   noise   and rejected  similarly  in radio cdma  each group of users is given a shared code  many codes occupy the same channel  but only users associated with a particular code can communicate  in general  cdma belongs to two basic categories  synchronous  orthogonal codes  and asynchronous  pseudorandom codes
