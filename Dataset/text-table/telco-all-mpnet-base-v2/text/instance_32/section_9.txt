  see alsodirectsequence spread spectrumnearfar problem   when mobiletobase links can not be precisely coordinated  particularly due to the mobility of the handsets  a different approach is required  since it is not mathematically possible to create signature sequences that are both orthogonal for arbitrarily random starting points and which make full use of the code space  unique  pseudorandom  or  pseudonoise  sequences called spreading sequences are used in asynchronous cdma systems  a spreading sequence is a binary sequence that appears random but can be reproduced in a deterministic manner by intended receivers  these spreading sequences are used to encode and decode a user signal in asynchronous cdma in the same manner the orthogonal codes in synchronous cdma  shown in the example above   these spreading sequences are statistically uncorrelated  and the sum of a large number of spreading sequences results in multiple access interference  mai  that is approximated by a gaussian noise process  following the   central limit theorem   in statistics     gold code   are an example of a spreading sequence suitable for this purpose  there is low correlation between the codes  if all of the users are received with the same power level  then the variance  eg  the noise power  of the mai increases in direct proportion to the number of users  in other words  unlike synchronous cdma  the signals of other users will appear noise to the signal of interest and interfere slightly with the desired signal in proportion to number of users  all forms of cdma use the   spreadspectrum     spreading factor   to allow receivers to partially discriminate against unwanted signals  signals encoded with the specified spreading sequences are received  while signals with different sequences  or the same sequences but different timing offsets  appear wideband noise reduced by the spreading factor  since each user generates mai  controlling the signal strength is an important issue with cdma transmitters  a cdm  synchronous cdma   tdma  or fdma receiver can in theory completely reject arbitrarily strong signals using different codes  time slots or frequency channels due to the orthogonality of these systems  this is not true for asynchronous cdma  rejection of unwanted signals is only partial  if any or all of the unwanted signals are much stronger than the desired signal  they will overwhelm it  this leads to a general requirement in any asynchronous cdma system to approximately match the various signal power levels seen at the receiver  in cdma cellular  the base station uses a fast closedloop powercontrol scheme to tightly control each mobile transmit power  in 2019  schemes to precisely estimate the required length of the codes in dependence of doppler and delay characteristics have been developed  ref    cite conferencelastenneking  antreich  appel  almeidadate2019titlepure pilot signals  how short can we choose gnss spreading codes  urlhttps  wwwresearchgatenetpublication331065214booktitleproceedings of the 2019 international technical meeting of the institute of navigationpages925935doi1033012201916737isbn9780936406213s2cid86666944    ref  soon after  machine learning based techniques that generate sequences of a desired length and spreading properties have been published well  these are highly competitive with the classic gold and welch sequences  these are not generated by linearfeedbackshiftregisters  but have to be stored in lookup tables
