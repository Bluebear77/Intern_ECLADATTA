Title: Spread-spectrum characteristics of CDMA

Value:
most modulation schemes try to minimize the bandwidth of this signal since bandwidth is a limited resource  however  spreadspectrum techniques use a transmission bandwidth that is several orders of magnitude greater than the minimum required signal bandwidth  one of the initial reasons for doing this was military applications including guidance and communication systems  these systems were designed using spread spectrum because of its security and resistance to jamming  asynchronous cdma has some level of privacy built in because the signal is spread using a pseudorandom code  this code makes the spreadspectrum signals appear random or have noiselike properties  a receiver can not demodulate this transmission without knowledge of the pseudorandom sequence used to encode the data  cdma is also resistant to jamming  a jamming signal only has a finite amount of power available to jam the signal  the jammer can either spread its energy over the entire bandwidth of the signal or jam only part of the entire signal  ref name  ref 3     ref name  ref 4    cdma can also effectively reject narrowband interference  since narrowband interference affects only a small portion of the spreadspectrum signal  it can easily be removed through notch filtering without much loss of information    convolution encoding   and   forward error correction  interleavinginterleaving   can be used to assist in recovering this lost data  cdma signals are also resistant to multipath fading  since the spreadspectrum signal occupies a large bandwidth  only a small portion of this will undergo fading due to multipath at any given time  like the narrowband interference  this will result in only a small loss of data and can be overcome  another reason cdma is resistant to multipath interference is because the delayed versions of the transmitted pseudorandom codes will have poor correlation with the original pseudorandom code  and will thus appear another user  which is ignored at the receiver  in other words  long the multipath channel induces at least one chip of delay  the multipath signals will arrive at the receiver such that they are shifted in time by at least one chip from the intended signal  the correlation properties of the pseudorandom codes are such that this slight delay causes the multipath to appear uncorrelated with the intended signal  and it is thus ignored  some cdma devices use a   rake receiver    which exploits multipath delay components to improve the performance of the system  a rake receiver combines the information from several correlators  each one tuned to a different path delay  producing a stronger version of the signal than a simple receiver with a single correlation tuned to the path delay of the strongest signal  ref name  ref 1     ref name  ref 2    frequency reuse is the ability to reuse the same radio channel frequency at other cell sites within a cellular system  in the fdma and tdma systems  frequency planning is an important consideration  the frequencies used in different cells must be planned carefully to ensure signals from different cells do not interfere with each other  in a cdma system  the same frequency can be used in every cell  because channelization is done using the pseudorandom codes  reusing the same frequency in every cell eliminates the need for frequency planning in a cdma system  however  planning of the different pseudorandom sequences must be done to ensure that the received signal from one cell does not correlate with the signal from a nearby cell  ref name  ref 1    since adjacent cells use the same frequencies  cdma systems have the ability to perform soft handoffs  soft handoffs allow the mobile telephone to communicate simultaneously with two or more cells  the best signal quality is selected until the handoff is complete  this is different from hard handoffs utilized in other cellular systems  in a hardhandoff situation  the mobile telephone approaches a handoff  signal strength may vary abruptly  in contrast  cdma systems use the soft handoff  which is undetectable and provides a more reliable and higherquality signal  ref name  ref 2
