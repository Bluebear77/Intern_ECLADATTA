  image  cdma orthogonal signalspngthumbrightan example of 4 mutually orthogonal digital signals   start with a set of vectors that are mutually   orthogonalityorthogonal     although mutual orthogonality is the only condition  these vectors are usually constructed for ease of decoding  for example columns or rows from   walsh matrixwalsh matrices     an example of orthogonal functions is shown in the adjacent picture  these vectors will be assigned to individual users and are called the code    chip  cdma  chip   code  or chipping code  in the interest of brevity  the rest of this example uses codes v with only two bits  each user is associated with a different code  say v a 1 bit is represented by transmitting a positive code v  and a 0 bit is represented by a negative code v  for example  if v   v  sub  0  sub   v  sub  1  sub     1  1  and the data that the user wishes to transmit is  1  0  1  1   then the transmitted symbols would be   v  v  v  v    v  sub  0  sub   v  sub  1  sub   v  sub  0  sub   v  sub  1  sub   v  sub  0  sub   v  sub  1  sub   v  sub  0  sub   v  sub  1  sub     1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1   for the purposes of this article  we call this constructed vector the transmitted vector  each sender has a different  unique vector v chosen from that set  but the construction method of the transmitted vector is identical  now  due to physical properties of interference  if two signals at a point are in phase  they add to give twice the amplitude of each signal  but if they are out of phase  they subtract and give a signal that is the difference of the amplitudes  digitally  this behaviour can be modelled by the addition of the transmission vectors  component by component  if sender0 has code  1  1  and data  1  0  1  1   and sender1 has code  1  1  and data  0  0  1  1   and both senders transmit simultaneously  then this table describes the coding steps  because signal0 and signal1 are transmitted at the same time into the air  they add to produce the raw signal   1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1    1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1    0  2  2  0  2  0  2  0   this raw signal is called an interference pattern  the receiver then extracts an intelligible signal for any known sender by combining the sender code with the interference pattern  the following table explains how this works and shows that the signals do not interfere with one another  further  after decoding  all values greater than 0 are interpreted 1  while all values less than zero are interpreted 0  for example  after decoding  data0 is  2  2  2  2   but the receiver interprets this  1  0  1  1   values of exactly 0 mean that the sender did not transmit any data  in the following example  assume signal0   1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  is transmitted alone  the following table shows the decode at the receiver  when the receiver attempts to decode the signal using sender1 code  the data is all zeros  therefore the crosscorrelation is equal to zero and it is clear that sender1 did not transmit any data
