Title: Efficient practical utilization of the fixed frequency spectrum

Value:
in theory cdma  tdma and fdma have exactly the same spectral efficiency  but  in practice  each has its own challenges  power control in the case of cdma  timing in the case of tdma  and frequency generationfiltering in the case of fdma  tdma systems must carefully synchronize the transmission times of all the users to ensure that they are received in the correct time slot and do not cause interference  since this can not be perfectly controlled in a mobile environment  each time slot must have a guard time  which reduces the probability that users will interfere  but decreases the spectral efficiency  similarly  fdma systems must use a guard band between adjacent channels  due to the unpredictable   doppler effectdoppler shift   of the signal spectrum because of user mobility  the guard bands will reduce the probability that adjacent channels will interfere  but decrease the utilization of the spectrum
