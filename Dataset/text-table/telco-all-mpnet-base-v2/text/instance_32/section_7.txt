Title: Code-division multiplexing (synchronous CDMA)

Value:
the digital modulation method is analogous to those used in simple radio transceivers  in the analog case  a lowfrequency data signal is timemultiplied with a highfrequency pure sinewave carrier and transmitted  this is effectively a frequency convolution    wienerkhinchin theorem    of the two signals  resulting in a carrier with narrow sidebands  in the digital case  the sinusoidal carrier is replaced by   walsh function   these are binary square waves that form a complete orthonormal set  the data signal is also binary and the time multiplication is achieved with a simple xor function  this is usually a   gilbert cell   mixer in the circuitry  synchronous cdma exploits mathematical properties of   orthogonality   between   coordinate vectorvectors   representing the data strings  for example  the binary string 1011 is represented by the vector  1  0  1  1   vectors can be multiplied by taking their   dot product    by summing the products of their respective components  for example  if u   a  b  and v      then their dot product uv  ac  bd   if the dot product is zero  the two vectors are said to be orthogonal to each other  some properties of the dot product aid understanding of how   wcdma   works  if vectors a and b are orthogonal  then  math  mathbf  a  cdotmathbf  b   0  math  and    math  mathbf  a  cdot  mathbf  a   mathbf  b    mathbf  a  2   text  since   mathbf  a  cdotmathbf  a   mathbf  a  cdotmathbf  b   mathbf  a  2  0   math    math  mathbf  a  cdot  mathbf  a   mathbf  b    mathbf  a  2   text  since    mathbf  a   cdotmathbf  a   mathbf  a  cdotmathbf  b   mathbf  a  2  0   math    math  mathbf  b  cdot  mathbf  a   mathbf  b    mathbf  b  2   text  since   mathbf  b  cdotmathbf  a   mathbf  b  cdotmathbf  b   0  mathbf  b  2   math    math  mathbf  b  cdot  mathbf  a   mathbf  b    mathbf  b  2   text  since   mathbf  b  cdotmathbf  a   mathbf  b  cdotmathbf  b   0  mathbf  b  2   math  each user in synchronous cdma uses a code orthogonal to the others  codes to modulate their signal  an example of 4 mutually orthogonal digital signals is shown in the figure below  orthogonal codes have a crosscorrelation equal to zero  in other words  they do not interfere with each other  in the case of is95  64bit   walsh code   are used to encode the signal to separate different users  since each of the 64 walsh codes is orthogonal to all other  the signals are channelized into 64 orthogonal signals  the following example demonstrates how each user signal can be encoded and decoded
