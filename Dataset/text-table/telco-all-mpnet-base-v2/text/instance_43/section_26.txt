Title: Other competing standards

Value:
the main competitor to umts is cdma2000  imtmc   which is developed by the   3gpp2    unlike umts  cdma2000 is an evolutionary upgrade to an existing 2g standard  cdmaone  and is able to operate within the same frequency allocations  this and cdma2000 narrower bandwidth requirements make it easier to deploy in existing spectra  in some  but not all  cases  existing gsm operators only have enough spectrum to implement either umts or gsm  not both  for example  in the us  e  and f pcs spectrum blocks  the amount of spectrum available is 5 mhz in each direction  a standard umts system would saturate that spectrum  where cdma2000 is deployed  it usually coexists with umts  in many markets however  the coexistence issue is of little relevance  legislative hurdles exist to codeploying two standards in the same licensed slice of spectrum  another competitor to umts is   edge    imtsc   which is an evolutionary upgrade to the 2g gsm system  leveraging existing gsm spectrums  it is also much easier  quicker  and considerably cheaper for wireless carriers to  bolton  edge functionality by upgrading their existing gsm transmission hardware to support edge rather than having to install almost all brandnew equipment to deliver umts  however  being developed by 3gpp just umts  edge is not a true competitor  instead  it is used a temporary solution preceding umts rollout or a complement for rural areas  this is facilitated by the fact that gsmedge and umts specifications are jointly developed and rely the same core network  allowing dualmode operation including   vertical handover   china   tdscdma   standard is often seen a competitor  too  tdscdma has been added to umts  release 4 utratdd 128 mcps low chip rate  utratdd lcr   unlike   tdcdma    utratdd 384 mcps high chip rate  utratdd hcr  which complements wcdma  utrafdd   it is suitable for both micro and macrocells  however  the lack of vendors  support is preventing it from being a real competitor  while dect is technically capable of competing with umts and other cellular networks in densely populated  urban areas  it has only been deployed for domestic cordless phones and private inhouse networks  all of these competitors have been accepted by itu part of the imt2000 family of 3g standards  along with umtsfdd  the internet access side  competing systems include wimax and   flashofdm
