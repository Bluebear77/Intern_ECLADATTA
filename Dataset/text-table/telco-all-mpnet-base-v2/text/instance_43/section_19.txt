Title: Radio access network

Value:
  mainutran   umts also specifies the universal terrestrial radio access network  utran   which is composed of multiple base stations  possibly using different terrestrial air interface standards and frequency bands  umts and gsmedge can share a core network  cn   making utran an alternative radio access network to   geran    gsmedge ran   and allowing  mostly  transparent switching between the rans according to available coverage and service needs  because of that  umts and gsmedge radio access networks are sometimes collectively referred to utrangeran  umts networks are often combined with gsmedge  the latter of which is also a part of imt2000  the ue    user equipmentuser equipment    interface of the   radio access networkran    radio access network  primarily consists of   radio resource controlrrc    radio resource control     pdcp    packet data convergence protocol     radio link controlrlc    radio link control  and mac  media access control  protocols  rrc protocol handles connection establishment  measurements  radio bearer services  security and handover decisions  rlc protocol primarily divides into three modes   snd   transparent mode  tm   unacknowledge mode  um   acknowledge mode  am   the functionality of am entity resembles tcp operation whereas um operation resembles udp operation  in tm mode  data will be sent to lower layers without adding any header to   service data unitsdu   of higher layers  mac handles the scheduling of data air interface depending higher layer  rrc  configured parameters  the set of properties related to data transmission is called radio bearer  rb   this set of properties decides the maximum allowed data in a tti  transmission time interval   rb includes rlc information and rb mapping  rb mapping decides the mapping between rb    logical channel    transport channel  signaling messages are sent signaling radio bearers  srbs  and data packets  either cs or ps  are sent data rbs  rrc and   non access stratumnas   messages go srbs  security includes two procedures  integrity and ciphering  integrity validates the resource of messages and also makes sure that no one  thirdunknown party  the radio interface has modified the messages  ciphering ensures that no one listens to your data the air interface  both integrity and ciphering are applied for srbs whereas only ciphering is applied for data rbs
