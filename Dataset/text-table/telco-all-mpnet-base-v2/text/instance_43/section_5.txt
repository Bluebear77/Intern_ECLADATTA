in the late 1990s  wcdma was developed by ntt docomo the air interface for their 3g network   foma    later ntt docomo submitted the specification to the   international telecommunication union    itu  a candidate for the international 3g standard known imt2000  the itu eventually accepted wcdma part of the imt2000 family of 3g standards  an alternative to cdma2000  edge  and the short range   dect   system  later  wcdma was selected an air interface for   umts frequency bandsumts    ntt docomo did not wait for the finalisation of the 3g release 99 specification  their network was initially incompatible with umts  ref    citationauthorhsiaohwa chentitlethe next generation cdma technologiespublisherjohn wiley and sonsyear2007isbn9780470022948pages105106    ref  however  this has been resolved by ntt docomo updating their network  codedivision multiple access communication networks have been developed by a number of companies over the years  but development of cellphone networks based cdma  prior to wcdma  was dominated by   qualcomm    the first company to succeed in developing a practical and costeffective cdma implementation for consumer cell phones and its early   cdmaoneis95   air interface standard has evolved into the current cdma2000  is856is2000  standard  qualcomm created an experimental wideband cdma system called cdma2000 3x which unified the wcdma    3rd generation partnership project3gpp    and cdma2000    3rd generation partnership project 23gpp2    network technologies into a single design for a worldwide standard air interface  compatibility with cdma2000 would have beneficially enabled roaming existing networks beyond japan  since qualcomm cdma2000 networks are widely deployed  especially in the americas  with coverage in 58 countries   of2006lcon    however  divergent requirements resulted in the wcdma standard being retained and deployed globally  wcdma has then become the dominant technology with 457 commercial networks in 178 countries of april 2012  ref    cite weburlhttp  wwwgsacomcomdownloadspdfhspa_operator_commitments_160412php4titlegsm association hspa market update april 2012    ref  several cdma2000 operators have even converted their networks to wcdma for international roaming compatibility and smooth upgrade path to   lte  telecommunication  lte    despite incompatibility with existing airinterface standards  late introduction and the high upgrade cost of deploying an allnew transmitter technology  wcdma has become the dominant standard
