Title: Interoperability and global roaming

Value:
umts phones  and data cards  are highly portable   snd   they have been designed to roam easily onto other umts networks  if the providers have roaming agreements in place   in addition  almost all umts phones are umtsgsm dualmode devices  so if a umts phone travels outside of umts coverage during a call the call may be transparently handed off to available gsm coverage  roaming charges are usually significantly higher than regular usage charges  most umts licensees consider ubiquitous  transparent global   roaming   an important issue  to enable a high degree of interoperability  umts phones usually support several different frequencies in addition to their gsm fallback  different countries support different umts frequency bands   snd   europe initially used 2100 mhz while the most carriers in the usa use 850 mhz and 1900 mhz  tmobile has launched a network in the us operating at 1700 mhz  uplink  2100 mhz  downlink   and these bands also have been adopted elsewhere in the us and in canada and latin america  a umts phone and network must support a common frequency to work together  because of the frequencies used  early models of umts phones designated for the united states will likely not be operable elsewhere and vice versa  there are now 11 different frequency combinations used around the world   snd   including frequencies formerly used solely for 2g services  umts phones can use a   universal subscriber identity module    usim  based gsm   sim card    and also work  including umts services  with gsm sim cards  this is a global standard of identification  and enables a network to identify and authenticate the  u  sim in the phone  roaming agreements between networks allow for calls to a customer to be redirected to them while roaming and determine the services  and prices  available to the user  in addition to user subscriber information and authentication information  the  u  sim provides storage space for phone book contact  handsets can store their data their own memory or the  u  sim card  which is usually more limited in its phone book contact information   a  u  sim can be moved to another umts or gsm phone  and the phone will take the user details of the  u  sim  meaning it is the  u  sim  not the phone  which determines the phone number of the phone and the billing for calls made from the phone  japan was the first country to adopt 3g technologies  and since they had not used gsm previously they had no need to build gsm compatibility into their handsets and their 3g handsets were smaller than those available elsewhere  in 2002  ntt docomo foma 3g network was the first commercial umts network   snd   using a prerelease specification   ref    citationauthorhsiaohwa chenpublisherjohn wiley and sonsyear2007titlethe next generation cdma technologiesisbn9780470022948pages105106    ref  it was initially incompatible with the umts standard at the radio level but used standard usim cards  meaning usim card based roaming was possible  transferring the usim card into a umts or gsm phone when travelling   both ntt docomo and softbank mobile  which launched 3g in december 2002  now use standard umts
