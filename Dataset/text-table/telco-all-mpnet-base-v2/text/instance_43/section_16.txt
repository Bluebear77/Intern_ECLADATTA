Title: Comparison with UMTS-FDD

Value:
ordinary umts uses utrafdd an air interface and is known   umtsfdd    umtsfdd uses wcdma for multiple access and   frequencydivision duplex   for duplexing  meaning that the uplink and downlink transmit different frequencies  umts is usually transmitted frequencies assigned for   1g      2g    or 3g mobile telephone service in the countries of operation  umtstdd uses timedivision duplexing  allowing the uplink and downlink to share the same spectrum  this allows the operator to more flexibly divide the usage of available spectrum according to traffic patterns  for ordinary phone service  you would expect the uplink and downlink to carry approximately equal amounts of data  because every phone call needs a voice transmission in either direction   but internetoriented traffic is more frequently oneway  for example  when browsing a website  the user will send commands  which are short  to the server  but the server will send whole files  that are generally larger than those commands  in response  umtstdd tends to be allocated frequency intended for mobilewireless internet services rather than used existing cellular frequencies  this is  in part  because tdd duplexing is not normally allowed   mobile phonecellular      personal communications servicepcs   pcn  and 3g frequencies  tdd technologies open up the usage of leftover unpaired spectrum  europewide  several bands are provided either specifically for umtstdd or for similar technologies  these are 1900 mhz and 1920 mhz and between 2010 mhz and 2025 mhz  in several countries the 2500   dash   2690 mhz band  also known mmds in the usa  have been used for umtstdd deployments  additionally  spectrum around the 35 ghz range has been allocated in some countries  notably britain  in a technologyneutral environment  in the czech republic utmstdd is also used in a frequency range around 872 mhz  ref    cite webtitletmobile launches umts tdd network in the czech republicurlhttp  wwwgeekzoneconzcontentasp  contentid4693date21 june 2005    ref
