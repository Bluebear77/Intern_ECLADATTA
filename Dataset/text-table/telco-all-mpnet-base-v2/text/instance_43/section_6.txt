Title: Rationale for W-CDMA

Value:
wcdma transmits a pair of 5 mhzwide radio channels  while cdma2000 transmits one or several pairs of 125 mhz radio channels  though wcdma does use a   directsequence spread spectrumdirectsequence   cdma transmission technique like cdma2000  wcdma is not simply a wideband version of cdma2000 and differs in many aspects from cdma2000  from an engineering point of view  wcdma provides a different balance of tradeoffs between cost  capacity  performance  and density   citation neededdatenovember 2011    it also promises to achieve a benefit of reduced cost for video phone handsets  wcdma may also be better suited for deployment in the very dense cities of europe and asia  however  hurdles remain  and   crosslicensing   of   patent   between qualcomm and wcdma vendors has not eliminated possible patent issues due to the features of wcdma which remain covered by qualcomm patents  ref    cite weburlhttp  wwwinfoworldcomarticle070405hnqualcommonnokiapatents_1htmltitlequalcomm says it does nt need nokia patents    ref  wcdma has been developed into a complete set of specifications  a detailed protocol that defines how a mobile phone communicates with the tower  how signals are modulated  how datagrams are structured  and system interfaces are specified allowing free competition technology elements
