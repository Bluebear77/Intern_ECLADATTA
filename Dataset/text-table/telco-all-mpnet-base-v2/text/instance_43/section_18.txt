Title: Competing standards

Value:
a variety of internetaccess systems exist which provide broadband speed access to the net  these include wimax and   hiperman    umtstdd has the advantages of being able to use an operator existing umtsgsm infrastructure  should it have one  and that it includes umts modes optimized for circuit switching should  for example  the operator want to offer telephone service  umtstdd performance is also more consistent  however  umtstdd deployers often have regulatory problems with taking advantage of some of the services umts compatibility provides  for example  the umtstdd spectrum in the uk can not be used to provide telephone service  though the regulator   ofcom   is discussing the possibility of allowing it at some point in the future  few operators considering umtstdd have existing umtsgsm infrastructure  additionally  the wimax and hiperman systems provide significantly larger bandwidths when the mobile station is near the tower  like most mobile internet access systems  many users who might otherwise choose umtstdd will find their needs covered by the ad hoc collection of unconnected wifi access points at many restaurants and transportation hubs  andor by internet access already provided by their mobile phone operator  by comparison  umtstdd  and systems like wimax  offers mobile  and more consistent  access than the former  and generally faster access than the latter
