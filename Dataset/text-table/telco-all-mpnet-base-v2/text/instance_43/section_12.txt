Title: Technical highlights

Value:
tdscdma uses tdd  in contrast to the fdd scheme used by   wcdma    by dynamically adjusting the number of timeslots used for downlink and   uplink    the system can more easily accommodate asymmetric traffic with different data rate requirements downlink and uplink than fdd schemes  since it does not require paired spectrum for downlink and uplink  spectrum allocation flexibility is also increased  using the same carrier frequency for uplink and downlink also means that the channel condition is the same both directions  and the   base station   can deduce the downlink channel information from uplink channel estimates  which is helpful to the application of   beamforming   techniques  tdscdma also uses tdma in addition to the cdma used in wcdma  this reduces the number of users in each timeslot  which reduces the implementation complexity of   multiuser detection   and beamforming schemes  but the noncontinuous transmission also reduces   coverage  telecommunication  coverage    because of the higher peak power needed   mobility  because of lower   power control   frequency  and complicates   radio resource management   algorithms  the   in tdscdma stands for  synchronous   which means that uplink signals are synchronized at the base station receiver  achieved by continuous timing adjustments  this reduces the   interference  communication  interference   between users of the same timeslot using different codes by improving the   orthogonality  communicationsorthogonality   between the codes  therefore increasing system capacity  at the cost of some hardware complexity in achieving uplink synchronization
