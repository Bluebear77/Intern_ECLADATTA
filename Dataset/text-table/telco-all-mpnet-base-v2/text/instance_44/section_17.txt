Title: Disadvantages

Value:
despite the apparent success of spectrum auctions  important disadvantages limiting efficiency and revenues are demand reduction and collusive bidding  the information and flexibility in the process of auction can be used to reduce auction prices by tacit collusion  when bidder competition is weak and one bidder holds an apparent advantage to win the auction for specific licenses  other bidders will often choose not to bid for higher prices  hence reducing the final revenue generated by the auction    citation neededdatemay 2011   in this case  the auction is best thought of a negotiation among the bidders  who agree who should win the auction for each discrete bit of spectrum    citation neededdatemay 2011   the foregoing notwithstanding  due to the complicated structure of spectrum auctions  it is not easy to identify collusive from noncollusive bidding  although simple analyses of bid behavior can provide an important basis for recommended changes to the rules and structure of the auctions  ref    cite journallast1bajarifirst1patricklast2yeofirst2jungwondateoctober 2008titleauction design and tacit collusion in fcc spectrum auctionsurlhttp  wwwnberorgpapersw14441doi103386w14441doiaccessfree    ref
