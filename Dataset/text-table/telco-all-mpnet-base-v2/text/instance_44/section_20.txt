Title: Simultaneous ascending multiple-round auction

Value:
in a simultaneous ascending multipleround  smr  auction  all licenses are available for bidding at the same time throughout the entire auction  thus the term  simultaneous   unlike most auctions in which bidding is continuous  smr auctions have discrete  successive rounds  with the length of each round announced in advance by the commission  participants may bid multiple licenses at once  after each round closes  round results are processed and made public  only then do bidders learn about the bids placed by other bidders  this provides information about the value of the licenses to all bidders and increases the likelihood that the licenses will be assigned to the bidders who value them the most  the period between auction rounds also allows bidders to take stock of  and perhaps adjust  their bidding strategies  in an smr auction  there is no preset number of rounds  all licenses will continue to be for sale until there are none left or there are no buyers  in other words  bidding continues round after round  until a round occurs in which all bidder activity ceases  that round becomes the closing round of the auction  ref    cite weburlhttps  wwwfccgovauctionsauctiondesignstitleauction designsdate20171211websitefederal communications commissionaccessdate20181210    ref
