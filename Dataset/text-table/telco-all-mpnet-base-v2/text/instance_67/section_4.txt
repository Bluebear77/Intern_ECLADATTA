Title: Range

the working range of a cell site  the range which mobile devices connects reliably to the cell site  is not a fixed figure  it will depend a number of factors  including  but not limited to   height of antenna over surrounding terrain    lineofsight propagation      the frequency of signal in use   the transmitter rated power   the required uplinkdownlink data rate of the subscriber device  ref   andrews  a gohsh  2007   fundamentals of wimax  p 43  ref   the directional characteristics of the site antenna array   reflection and absorption of radio energy by buildings or vegetation   it may also be limited by local geographical or regulatory factors and weather conditions   in addition there are timing limitations in some technologies  eg  even in free space  gsm would be limited to 150 km  with 180 km being possible with special equipment  generally  in areas where there are enough cell sites to cover a wide area  the range of each one will be set to   ensure there is enough overlap for    handover    tofrom other sites  moving the signal for a mobile device from one cell site to another  for those technologies that can handle it  eg  making a gsm phone call while in a car or train    ensure that the overlap area is not too large  to minimize interference problems with other sites  in practice  cell sites are grouped in areas of high population density  with the most potential users  cell phone traffic through a single site is limited by the base station capacity  there is a finite number of calls or data traffic that a base station can handle at once  this capacity limitation is commonly the factor that determines the spacing of cell mast sites  in suburban areas  masts are commonly spaced   convert23kmmiabbron   apart and in dense urban areas  masts may be close 400800 apart  ref    cite weburlhttps  wwwelectronicdesigncomcommunicationsunderstandingsmallcellwirelessbackhaultitleunderstanding smallcell wireless backhauldate3 april 2014websiteelectronic designaccessdate4 december 2019archivedate9 august 2020archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20200809003627http  electronicdesigncomcommunicationsunderstandingsmallcellwirelessbackhaulurlstatuslive    ref  the maximum range of a mast  where it is not limited by interference with other masts nearby  depends the same considerations  in any case the limiting factor is the ability of a lowpowered personal cell phone to transmit back to the mast  a rough guide  based a tall mast and flat   terrain    it may be possible to get between   convert50 and 70kmmiabbron    when the terrain is hilly  the maximum distance can vary from little   convert6 to 8kmmiabbron   due to encroachment of intermediate objects into the wide center   fresnel zone   of the signal  ref  frequently asked pcs questions undated  url retrieved 14 august 2007    webarchive urlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20060509174612http  wwwarcxcomsitesfaqhtm date9 may 2006    ref  depending terrain and other circumstances  a gsm tower can replace between   convert2 and 50mikm0abbronorderflip   of cabling for fixed wireless networks  ref  ntia seeks input broadband stimulus money undated  url retrieved 3 march 2009    webarchive urlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20091122053748http  wwwaccelnetworkscomblog200903ntiaseeksinputonbroadbandstimulushtml date22 november 2009    ref  in addition  some technologies  such gsm  have an additional absolute maximum range of   convert35kmmiabbron    which is imposed by   timing advancetechnical limitations    cdma and   integrated digital enhanced networkiden   have no such limit defined by timing
