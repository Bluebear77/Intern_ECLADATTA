Title: Channel reuse

Value:
the concept of  maximum  range is misleading in a cellular network  cellular networks are designed to support many conversations with a limited number of   radio channel    slices of   radio frequency spectrum   necessary to make one conversation  that are licensed to an operator of a cellular service  to overcome this limitation  it is necessary to repeat and   frequency reusereuse   the same channels at different locations  just a car radio changes from one local station to a completely different local station with the same frequency when traveling to another city  the same radio channel gets reused a cell mast only a few miles away  to do this  the signal of a cell mast is intentionally kept at low power and in many cases tilted downward to limit its reach  this allows covering an area small enough not to have to support more conversations than the available channels can carry  due to the sectorized arrangement of antennas a tower  it is possible to vary the strength and angle for each sector depending the coverage from other towers in the area
