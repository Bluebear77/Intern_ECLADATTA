Title: Overview

Value:
a   cellular network   is a network of handheld   mobile phone    cell phones  in which each phone communicates with the   telephone network   by   radio wave   through a local antenna at a cellular base station  cell site   the coverage area in which service is provided is divided into a mosaic of small geographical areas called  cells   each served by a separate low power multichannel   transceiver   and antenna at a base station  all the cell phones within a cell communicate with the system through that cell antenna  separate frequency channels assigned by the base station from a common pool of frequencies used by the system  the purpose of cellular organization is to conserve   bandwidth  signal processing  radio bandwidth   by   frequency reuse    the low power radio signals used within each cell do not travel far beyond the cell  so the   radio channel   can be reused in geographically separated cells  when a mobile user moves from one cell to another  their phone is automatically  handed off  to the new cell antenna  and assigned a new set of frequencies  and subsequently communicates with this antenna  this background handoff process is imperceptible to the user and can occur in the middle of a phone call without any service interruption  each cell phone has an automated   full duplex   digital   transceiver   and communicates with the cell antenna over two digital radio channels in the   ultrahigh frequencyuhf   or   microwave   band  one for each direction of the bidirectional conversation  plus a control channel which handles registering the phone with the network  dialing  and the handoff process  typically a cell tower is located at the edge of one or more cells and covers multiple cells using   directional antenna    a common geometry is to locate the cell site at the intersection of three adjacent cells  with three antennas at 120 angles each covering one cell  the type of antenna used for cellular base stations  vertical white rectangles in pictures   called a   sector antenna    usually consists of a vertical collinear array of   dipole antennadipole   it has a flat fanshaped   radiation pattern    which is tilted slightly down to cover the cell area without radiating at higher angles into further off cells which reuse the same frequencies  the elevation angle of the antenna must be carefully adjusted  so the beam covers the entire cell without radiating too far  in modern sector antennas beam tilt can usually be adjusted electronically  to avoid the necessity of a lineman climbing the tower to mechanically tilt the antenna when adjustment is needed
