Title: Signal limiting factor

Value:
a cellphone may not work at times because it is too far from a mast  or because the phone is in a location where cell phone signals are   attenuationattenuated   by thick building walls  hills  or other structures  the signals do not need a clear   lineofsight propagationline of sight   but greater   radio interference   will degrade or eliminate reception  when many people try to use the cell mast at the same time  eg  during a traffic jam or a sports event  then there will be a signal the phone display but it is blocked from starting a new connection  the other limiting factor for cell phones is the ability to send a signal from its low powered battery to the cell site  some cellphones perform better than others under low power or low battery  typically due to the ability to send a good signal from the phone to the mast  the   base station controller    a central computer that specializes in making phone connections  and the intelligence of the cellphone keeps track of and allows the phone to switch from one mast to the next during conversation  the user moves towards a mast it picks the strongest signal and releases the mast from which the signal has become weaker  that channel that mast becomes available to another user    furtherfrequency reuse
