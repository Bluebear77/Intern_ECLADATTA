Title: Voice codecs

Value:
gsm has used a variety of voice   codec   to squeeze 31 khz audio into between 7 and 13 kbits  originally  two codecs  named after the types of data channel they were allocated  were used  called   half rate    65 kbits  and   full rate    13 kbits   these used a system based   linear predictive coding    lpc   in addition to being efficient with   bitrate    these codecs also made it easier to identify more important parts of the audio  allowing the air interface layer to prioritize and better protect these parts of the signal  gsm was further enhanced in 1997  ref    cite web  url http  www3gpporgftpspecsarchive06_series06510651401zip  publisher etsi title gsm 0651 version 401  date  december 1997  format zip accessdate 5 september 2007    ref  with the   enhanced full rate    efr  codec  a 122 kbits codec that uses a fullrate channel  finally  with the development of   umts    efr was refactored into a variablerate codec called   adaptive multirateamrnarrowband    which is high quality and robust against interference when used fullrate channels  or less robust but still relatively high quality when used in good radio conditions halfrate channel
