Title: GSM security

Value:
gsm was intended to be a secure wireless system  it has considered the user authentication using a   preshared key   and   challengeresponse authenticationchallengeresponse    and overtheair encryption  however  gsm is vulnerable to different types of attack  each of them aimed at a different part of the network  ref  solutions to the gsm security weaknesses  proceedings of the 2nd ieee international conference next generation mobile applications  services  and technologies  ngmast2008   pp576581  cardiff  uk  september 2008    arxiv10023175    ref  the development of   universal mobile telecommunications systemumts   introduced an optional   universal subscriber identity module    usim   that uses a longer authentication key to give greater security  well mutually authenticating the network and the user  whereas gsm only authenticates the user to the network  and not vice versa   the security model therefore offers confidentiality and authentication  but limited authorization capabilities  and no   nonrepudiation    gsm uses several cryptographic algorithms for security  the   a51      a52    and   a53     stream cipher   are used for ensuring overtheair voice privacy  a51 was developed first and is a stronger algorithm used within europe and the united states  a52 is weaker and used in other countries  serious weaknesses have been found in both algorithms  it is possible to break a52 in realtime with a   ciphertextonly attack    and in january 2007  the hacker choice started the a51 cracking project with plans to use   fpga   that allow a51 to be broken with a   rainbow table   attack  ref    cite webauthorsteve urlhttps  wwwscribdcomdoc7227619crackinga5thcwikititlethe a51 cracking projectviascribdaccessdate3 november 2011    ref  the system supports multiple algorithms so operators may replace that cipher with a stronger one  since 2000  different efforts have been made in order to crack the a5 encryption algorithms  both a51 and a52 algorithms have been broken  and their cryptanalysis has been revealed in the literature  an example    karsten nohl   developed a number of   rainbow table    static values which reduce the time needed to carry out an attack  and have found new sources for   known plaintext attack    ref    cite newsurlhttps  wwwnytimescom20091229technology29hackhtmltitlecellphone encryption code is

ciphers and published the opensource  gprsdecode  software for   packet analyzersniffing   gprs networks  they also noted that some carriers do not encrypt the data  ie  using gea0  in order to detect the use of traffic or protocols they do not like  eg    skype     leaving customers unprotected  gea3 seems to remain relatively hard to break and is said to be in use some more modern networks  if used with   subscriber identity moduleusim   to prevent connections to fake base stations and   downgrade attack    users will be protected in the medium term  though migration to 128bit gea4 is still recommended  the first public cryptanalysis of gea1 and gea2  also written gea1 and gea2  was done in 2021  it concluded that although using a 64bit key  the gea1 algorithm actually provides only 40 bits of security  due to a relationship between two parts of the algorithm  the researchers found that this relationship was very unlikely to have happened if it was nt intentional  this may have been done in order to satisfy european controls export of cryptographic programs  ref    cite webtitlebombshell report finds phone network encryption was deliberately weakenedurlhttps
