Title: GSM carrier frequencies

Value:
  maingsm frequency bands   gsm networks operate in a number of different   carrier frequency   ranges  separated into   gsm frequency ranges   for 2g and   umts frequency bands   for 3g   with most   2g   gsm networks operating in the 900 mhz or 1800 mhz bands  where these bands were already allocated  the 850 mhz and 1900 mhz bands were used instead  for example in canada and the united states   in rare cases the 400 and 450 mhz frequency bands are assigned in some countries because they were previously used for firstgeneration systems  for comparison  most   3g   networks in europe operate in the 2100 mhz frequency band  for more information worldwide gsm frequency usage  see   gsm frequency bands    regardless of the frequency selected by an operator  it is divided into   timedivision multiplexingtimeslots   for individual phones  this allows eight fullrate or sixteen halfrate speech channels per   radio frequency    these eight radio timeslots  or   burst transmissionburst   periods  are grouped into a   timedivision multiple accesstdma   frame  halfrate channels use alternate frames in the same timeslot  the channel data rate for all   nowrap8 channels   is   nowrap270833 kbits    and the frame duration is   nowrap4615 ms     ref    cite web titlegsm frame structure  multiframe superframe hyperframe  electronics notes urlhttps  wwwelectronicsnotescomarticlesconnectivity2ggsmframestructuresuperframehyperframemultiframephp accessdate20230209 websitewwwelectronicsnotescom    ref  the transmission power in the handset is limited to a maximum of 2 watts in   nowrapgsm 850900   and   nowrap1 watt   in   nowrapgsm 18001900
