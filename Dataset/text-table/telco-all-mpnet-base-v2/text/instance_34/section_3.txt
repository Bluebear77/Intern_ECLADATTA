Title: System spectral efficiency or area spectral efficiency

Value:
in digital   wireless network    the system spectral efficiency or area spectral efficiency is typically measured in  bits  hz per unit area  in  bits  hz per   cell sitecell    or in  bits  hz per site  it is a measure of the quantity of users or services that can be simultaneously supported by a limited radio frequency bandwidth in a defined geographic area  ref namemiao  it may for example be defined the maximum aggregated   throughput   or   goodput    ie  summed over all users in the system  divided by the channel bandwidth and by the covered area or number of base station sites  this measure is affected not only by the singleuser transmission technique  but also by   multiple access   schemes and   radio resource management   techniques utilized  it can be substantially improved by dynamic   radio resource management    if it is defined a measure of the maximum goodput  retransmissions due to cochannel interference and collisions are excluded  higherlayer protocol overhead  above the   media access control   sublayer  is normally neglected   example 8  in a cellular system based   frequencydivision multiple access    fdma  with a   fixed channel allocation    fca  cellplan using a   frequency reuse factor   of 14  each base station has access to 14 of the total available frequency spectrum  thus  the maximum possible system spectral efficiency in  bits  hz per site is 14 of the link spectral efficiency  each base station may be divided into 3 cells by means of 3 sector antennas  also known a 412 reuse pattern  then each cell has access to 112 of the available spectrum  and the system spectral efficiency in  bits  hz per cell or  bits  hz per sector is 112 of the link spectral efficiency  the system spectral efficiency of a   cellular network   may also be expressed the maximum number of simultaneous phone calls per area unit over 1 mhz frequency spectrum in   erlang unite   mhz per cell  emhz per sector  emhz per site  or  emhz   sup  2  sup   this measure is also affected by the source coding  data compression  scheme  it may be used in analog cellular networks well  low link spectral efficiency in  bits  hz does not necessarily mean that an encoding scheme is inefficient from a system spectral efficiency point of view  an example  consider   cdmacode division multiplexed access  cdma      spread spectrum    which is not a particularly spectralefficient encoding scheme when considering a single channel or single user  however  the fact that one can  layer  multiple channels the same frequency band means that the system spectrum utilization for a multichannel cdma system can be very good   example 9  in the   wcdma   3g cellular system  every phone call is compressed to a maximum of 8500 bits  the useful bitrate   and spread out over a 5 mhz wide frequency channel  this corresponds to a link throughput of only 85005000000  00017  bits  hz  let us assume that 100 simultaneous  nonsilent  calls are possible in the same cell    spread spectrum   makes it possible to have low a frequency reuse factor 1  if each base station is divided into 3 cells by means of 3 directional sector antennas  this corresponds to a system spectrum efficiency of over 1  100  00017  017  bits  hz per site  and 0173  006  bits  hz per cell or sector  the spectral efficiency can be improved by   radio resource management   techniques such efficient fixed or dynamic   channel allocation      power control      link adaptation   and   diversity scheme    a combined   fairness measure   and system spectral efficiency measure is the   fairly shared spectral efficiency
