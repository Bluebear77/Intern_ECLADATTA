Value:
the link spectral efficiency of a digital communication system is measured in   bit      seconds      hertzhz     ref    cite book  title  principles of digital transmission  with wireless

pgra1pa219    ref  or  less frequently but unambiguously  in  bits  hz  it is the   net bit rate    useful information rate excluding   errorcorrecting code    or   maximum throughput   divided by the   bandwidth  signal processing  bandwidth   in hertz of a   communication channel   or a   data link    alternatively  the spectral efficiency may be measured in bitsymbol  which is equivalent to bits per   channel use    bpcu   implying that the net bit rate is divided by the   symbol rate    modulation rate  or line code pulse rate  link spectral efficiency is typically used to analyze the efficiency of a   digital modulation   method or   line code    sometimes in combination with a   forward error correction    fec  code and other physical layer overhead  in the latter case  a  bit  refers to a user data bit  fec overhead is always excluded  the modulation efficiency in bits is the   gross bit rate    including any errorcorrecting code  divided by the bandwidth   example 1  a transmission technique using one   kilohertz   of bandwidth to transmit 1000 bits per second has a modulation efficiency of 1  bits  hz   example 2  a   itut v92v92   modem for the telephone network can transfer 56000 bits downstream and 48000 bits upstream over an analog telephone network  due to filtering in the telephone exchange  the frequency range is limited to between 300 hertz and 3400 hertz  corresponding to a bandwidth of 3400  300  3100 hertz  the spectral efficiency or modulation efficiency is 560003100  181  bits  hz downstream  and 480003100  155  bits  hz upstream  an upper bound for the attainable modulation efficiency is given by the   nyquist rate   or   hartley law   follows  for a signaling alphabet with alternative symbols  each symbol represents  log  sub  2  sub  bits  is the modulation efficiency measured in bitsymbol or bpcu  in the case of   baseband   transmission    line coding   or   pulseamplitude modulation    with a baseband bandwidth  or upper cutoff frequency  b  the   symbol rate   can not exceed 2b symbolss in view to avoid   intersymbol interference    thus  the spectral efficiency can not exceed 2n  bits  hz in the baseband transmission case  in the   passband   transmission case  a signal with passband bandwidth w can be converted to an equivalent baseband signal  using   undersampling   or a   superheterodyne receiver     with upper cutoff frequency w2  if doublesideband modulation schemes such qam  ask  psk or ofdm are used  this results in a maximum symbol rate of w symbolss  and in that the modulation efficiency can not exceed  bits  hz  if digital   singlesideband modulation   is used  the passband signal with bandwidth w corresponds to a baseband message signal with baseband bandwidth w  resulting in a maximum symbol rate of 2w and an attainable modulation efficiency of 2n  bits  hz   example 3  a 16qam modem has an alphabet size of  16 alternative symbols  with  4 bitsymbol or bpcu  since qam is a form of double sideband passband transmission  the spectral efficiency can not exceed  4  bits  hz   example 4  the   8vsb    8level vestigial sideband  modulation scheme used in the   atsc digital television standard   gives n3 bitsymbol or bpcu  since it can be described nearly singleside band  the modulation efficiency is close to 2n  6  bits  hz  in practice  atsc transfers a gross bit rate of 32 mbits over a 6 mhz wide channel  resulting in a modulation efficiency of 326  53  bits  hz   example 5  the downlink of a v92 modem uses a pulseamplitude modulation with 128 signal levels  resulting in  7 bitsymbol  since the transmitted signal before passband filtering can be considered baseband transmission  the spectral efficiency can not exceed 2n  14  bits  hz over the full baseband channel  0 to 4 khz   seen above  a higher spectral efficiency is achieved if we consider the smaller passband bandwidth  if a   forward error correction   code is used  the spectral efficiency is reduced from the uncoded modulation efficiency figure   example 6  if a forward error correction  fec  code with   code rate   12 is added  meaning that the encoder input bit rate is one half the encoder output rate  the spectral efficiency is 50  of the modulation efficiency  in exchange for this reduction in spectral efficiency  fec usually reduces the   biterror rate    and typically enables operation at a lower   signaltonoise ratio    snr   an upper bound for the spectral efficiency possible without   bit error   in a channel with a certain snr  if ideal error coding and modulation is assumed  is given by the   shannonhartley theorem     example 7  if the snr is 1  corresponding to 0   decibel    the link spectral efficiency can not exceed 1  bits  hz for errorfree detection  assuming an ideal errorcorrecting code  according to shannonhartley regardless of the modulation and coding  note that the   goodput    the amount of application layer useful information  is normally lower than the   maximum throughput   used in the above calculations  because of packet retransmissions  higher protocol layer overhead  flow control  congestion avoidance  etc  the other hand  a data compression scheme  such the   itut v44v44   or   itut v42bisv42bis   compression used in telephone modems  may however give higher goodput if the transferred data is not already efficiently compressed  the link spectral efficiency of a wireless telephony link may also be expressed the maximum number of simultaneous calls over 1 mhz frequency spectrum in erlangs per megahertz  or   erlang unite   mhz  this measure is also affected by the source coding  data compression  scheme  it may be applied to analog well digital transmission  in wireless networks  the link spectral efficiency can be somewhat misleading  larger values are not necessarily more efficient in their overall use of radio spectrum  in a wireless network  high link spectral efficiency may result in high sensitivity to cochannel interference  crosstalk   which affects the capacity  for example  in a   cellular telephone   network with frequency reuse    spread spectrumspectrum spreading   and   forward error correction   reduce the spectral efficiency in  bits  hz but substantially lower the required signaltonoise ratio in comparison to nonspread spectrum techniques  this can allow for much denser geographical frequency reuse that compensates for the lower link spectral efficiency  resulting in approximately the same capacity  the same number of simultaneous phone calls  over the same bandwidth  using the same number of base station transmitters  discussed below  a more relevant measure for wireless networks would be system spectral efficiency in bitshz per unit area  however  in closed communication links such telephone lines and cable tv networks  and in noiselimited wireless communication system where cochannel interference is not a factor  the largest link spectral efficiency that can be supported by the available snr is generally used
