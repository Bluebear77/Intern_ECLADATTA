Value:
in the field of mobile communications  a  generation  generally refers to a change in the fundamental nature of the service  nonbackwardscompatible transmission technology  higher peak bit rates  new frequency bands  wider channel frequency bandwidth in hertz  and higher capacity for many simultaneous data transfers  higher   system spectral efficiency   in   bit   secondhertzsite   new mobile generations have appeared about every ten years since the first move from 1981 analog  1g  to digital  2g  transmission in 1992  this was followed  in 2001  by 3g multimedia support    spread spectrum   transmission and a minimum peak bit rate of 200   kbits    in 20112012 to be followed by  real  4g  which refers to allip   packet switchingpacketswitched   networks giving mobile ultrabroadband  gigabit speed  access  while the itu has adopted recommendations for technologies that would be used for future global communications  they do not actually perform the standardization or development work themselves  instead relying the work of other standard bodies such ieee  wimax forum  and 3gpp  in the mid1990s  the   itur   standardization organization released the   imt2000   requirements a framework for what standards should be considered   3g   systems  requiring 2000 kbits peak bit rate  ref name  65     cite web titleimt2000 urlhttps  networkencyclopediacomimt2000 websitenetwork encyclopedia dateseptember 8  2019 accessdate4 march 2022    ref  in 2008  itur specified the   imt advanced    international mobile telecommunications advanced  requirements for 4g systems  the fastest 3gbased standard in the   umts   family is the   hspa   standard  which has been commercially available since 2009 and offers 21 mbits downstream  11 mbits upstream  without   mimo    ie  with only one antenna  and in 2011 accelerated up to 42 mbits peak bit rate downstream using either   dualcell hsdpadchspa    simultaneous use of two 5 mhz umts carriers   ref name  lteworld   62 commercial networks support dchspa  drives hspa investments lteworld february 7  2012  ref  or 2x2 mimo  in theory speeds up to 672 mbits are possible  but have not been deployed yet  the fastest 3gbased standard in the   cdma2000   family is the   evdo rev  b    which is available since 2010 and offers 1567 mbits downstream
