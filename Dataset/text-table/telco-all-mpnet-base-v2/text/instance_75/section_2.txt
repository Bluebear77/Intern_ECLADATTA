Title: Technical overview

Value:
in november 2008  the   iturinternational telecommunication unionradio communications sector    itur  specified a set of requirements for 4g standards  named the international mobile telecommunications advanced  imtadvanced  specification  setting peak speed requirements for 4g service at 100   megabits per second    mbits   125 megabytes per second  for high mobility communication  such from trains and cars  and 1   gigabit per second    gbits  for low mobility communication  such pedestrians and stationary users    ref name  imtadvancedrequirements     itur    report m2134  requirements related to technical performance for imtadvanced radio interface    approved in november 2008  ref  since the firstrelease versions of   mobile wimax   and   long term evolutionlte   support much less than 1 gbits peak bit rate  they are not fully imtadvanced compliant  but are often branded 4g by service providers  according to operators  a generation of the network refers to the deployment of a new nonbackwardcompatible technology  december 6  2010  itur recognized that these two technologies  well other beyond3g technologies that do not fulfill the imtadvanced requirements  could nevertheless be considered  4g   provided they represent forerunners to imtadvanced compliant versions and  a substantial level of improvement in performance and capabilities with respect to the initial third generation systems now deployed    ref name  ituseminar     cite web urlhttp  wwwituintnetpressofficepress_releases201048aspx titleitu world radiocommunication seminar highlights future communication technologies websiteinternational telecommunication union accessdatedecember 23  2010 archivedatejune 20  2012 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20120620090430http  wwwituintnetpressofficepress_releases201048aspx urlstatusdead    ref    mobile wimax release 2    also known wirelessmanadvanced or ieee 80216m  and   lte advanced    ltea  are imtadvanced compliant backwards compatible versions of the above two systems  standardized during the spring 2011    citation neededdatemarch 2012   and promising speeds in the order of 1 gbits  services were expected in 2013    update inlinedatedecember 2014   opposed to earlier generations  a 4g system does not support traditional   circuitswitched   telephony service  but instead relies all   internet protocol    ip  based communication such   ip telephony    seen below  the   spread spectrum   radio technology used in 3g systems is abandoned in all 4g candidate systems and replaced by   ofdma     multicarrier   transmission and other   singlecarrier fdmafrequencydomain equalization    fde  schemes  making it possible to transfer very high bit rates despite extensive   multipath propagationmultipath radio propagation    echoes   the peak bit rate is further improved by   smart antenna   arrays for   mimomultipleinput multipleoutput    mimo  communications
