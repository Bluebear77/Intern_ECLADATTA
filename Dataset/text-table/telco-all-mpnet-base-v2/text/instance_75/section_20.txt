Title: Multiplexing and access schemes

Value:
  importance sectiondatemay 2010   recently  new access schemes like   ofdmaorthogonal fdma    ofdma     scfdmasingle carrier fdma    scfdma   interleaved fdma  and   multicarrier codedivision multiple accessmulticarrier cdma    mccdma  are gaining more importance for the next generation systems  these are based efficient   fast fourier transformfft   algorithms and frequency domain equalization  resulting in a lower number of multiplications per second  they also make it possible to control the bandwidth and form the spectrum in a flexible way  however  they require advanced dynamic channel allocation and adaptive traffic scheduling    wimax   is using ofdma in the downlink and in the uplink  for the   lte  telecommunication     ofdma is used for the downlink  by contrast    singlecarrier fdma   is used for the uplink since ofdma contributes more to the   crest factorpapr   related issues and results in nonlinear operation of amplifiers  ifdma provides less power fluctuation and thus requires energyinefficient linear amplifiers  similarly  mccdma is in the proposal for the   80220ieee 80220   standard  these access schemes offer the same efficiencies older technologies like cdma  apart from this  scalability and higher data rates can be achieved  the other important advantage of the abovementioned access techniques is that they require less complexity for equalization at the receiver  this is an added advantage especially in the   mimo   environments since the   spatial multiplexing   transmission of mimo systems inherently require high complexity equalization at the receiver  in addition to improvements in these multiplexing systems  improved   modulation   techniques are being used  whereas earlier standards largely used   phaseshift keying    more efficient systems such 64   qam   are being proposed for use with the   3gpp long term evolution   standards
