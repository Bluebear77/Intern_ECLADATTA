Title: Beyond 4G research

Value:
  main5g   a major issue in 4g systems is to make the high bit rates available in a larger portion of the cell  especially to users in an exposed position in between several base stations  in current research  this issue is addressed by   macrodiversity   techniques  also known   cooperative diversitygroup cooperative relay    and also by beamdivision multiple access  bdma    ref  it r  program of   ministry of knowledge economymke   iita  2008f00401  5g mobile communication systems based beamdivision multiple access and relays with group cooperation    ref    pervasive network   are an amorphous and at present entirely hypothetical concept where the user can be simultaneously connected to several wireless access technologies and can seamlessly move between them  see   vertical handoff      ieee 80221     these access technologies can be   wifi      universal mobile telecommunications systemumts      enhanced data rates for gsm evolutionedge    or any other future access technology  included in this concept is also smartradio  also known   cognitive radio    technology to efficiently manage spectrum use and transmission power well the use of   mesh networkingmesh routing   protocols to create a pervasive network
