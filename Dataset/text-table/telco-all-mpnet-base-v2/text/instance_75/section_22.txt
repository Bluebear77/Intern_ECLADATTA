  mainmimomultiuser mimo   the performance of radio communications depends an antenna system  termed   smart antennasmart   or   intelligent antenna    recently    multiple antenna researchmultiple antenna technologies   are emerging to achieve the goal of 4g systems such high rate  high reliability  and long range communications  in the early 1990s  to cater for the growing data rate needs of data communication  many transmission schemes were proposed  one technology    spatial multiplexing    gained importance for its bandwidth conservation and power efficiency  spatial multiplexing involves deploying multiple antennas at the transmitter and at the receiver  independent streams can then be transmitted simultaneously from all the antennas  this technology  called   mimo    a branch of   intelligent antenna     multiplies the base data rate by  the smaller of  the number of transmit antennas or the number of receive antennas  apart from this  the reliability in transmitting high speed data in the fading channel can be improved by using more antennas at the transmitter or at the receiver  this is called transmit or receive diversity  both transmitreceive diversity and transmit spatial multiplexing are categorized into the spacetime coding techniques  which does not necessarily require the channel knowledge at the transmitter  the other category is closedloop multiple antenna technologies  which require channel knowledge at the transmitter
