Title: Check digit computation

Value:
  see alsoluhn algorithm   the last number of the imei is a   check digit    calculated using the   luhn algorithm    defined in the imei allocation and approval guidelines   blockquote  the check digit shall be calculated according to   luhn algorithmluhn formula    isoiec 7812    see gsm 0216  3gpp 22016   the check digit is a function of all other digits in the imei  the software version number  svn  of a mobile is not included in the calculation  the purpose of the check digit is to help guard against the possibility of incorrect entries to the ceir and eir equipment  the presentation of the check digit both electronically and in printed form the label and packaging is very important  logistics  using barcode reader  and eirceir administration can not use the check digit unless it is printed outside of the packaging  and the imeitype accreditation label  the check digit is not transmitted over the radio interface  nor is it stored in the eir database at any point  therefore  all references to the last three or six digits of an imei refer to the actual imei number  to which the check digit does not belong   blockquote  the check digit is validated in three steps   starting from the right  double every other digit  eg  7  14    sum the digits  eg  14  1  4    check if the sum is divisible by 10  conversely  one can calculate the imei by choosing the check digit that would give a sum divisible by 10  for the example imei 49015420323751   to make the sum divisible by 10  we set   mathx    8  so the complete imei becomes 490154203237518
