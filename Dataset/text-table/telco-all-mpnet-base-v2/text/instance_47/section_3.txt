Title: Blocklists of stolen devices

Value:
when someone has their mobile equipment stolen or lost  they can ask their service provider to block the phone from their network  and the operator may do so  especially if required by law  if the local operator maintains an equipment identity register  eir   it adds the device imei to it  optionally  it also adds the imei to shared registries  such the   central equipment identity register    ceir   which blocklists the device with other operators that use the ceir  this blocklisting makes the device unusable any operator that uses the ceir  which makes mobile equipment theft pointless  except for parts  to make blocklisting effective  the imei number is supposed to be difficult to change  however  a phone imei may be easy to change with special tools  ref    cite web  url  http
