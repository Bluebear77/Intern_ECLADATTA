Title: Proposals

Value:
the target of 3gpp lte advanced is to reach and surpass the   international telecommunication unionitu   requirements  lte advanced should be compatible with first release lte equipment  and should share frequency bands with first release lte  in the feasibility study for lte advanced    3gpp   determined that lte advanced would meet the   itur   requirements for   4g    the results of the study are published in   3gpp   technical report  tr  36912  ref  agilent   cite web urlhttp  cpliteratureagilentcomlitwebpdf59906706enpdf titlearchived copy accessdate20110728 urlstatusdead archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20110303201709http  cpliteratureagilentcomlitwebpdf59906706enpdf archivedate20110303    introducing lteadvanced  p 6  march 8  2011  accessed july 28  2011  ref  one of the important lte advanced benefits is the ability to take advantage of advanced topology networks  optimized heterogeneous networks with a mix of macrocells with low power nodes such   picocell      femtocell   and new relay nodes  the next significant performance leap in wireless networks will come from making the most of topology  and brings the network closer to the user by adding many of these low power nodes   snd   lte advanced further improves the capacity and coverage  and ensures user fairness  lte advanced also introduces multicarrier to be able to use ultra wide bandwidth  up to 100 mhz of spectrum supporting very high data rates  in the research phase many proposals have been studied candidates for lte advanced  ltea  technologies  the proposals could roughly be categorized into   ref  nomor research  white paper lte advanced  ref   support for relay node base stations  coordinated multipoint  comp  transmission and reception  ue dual tx antenna solutions for   sumimo   and diversity   mimo    commonly referred to 2x2 mimo  scalable system   bandwidth  signal processing  bandwidth   exceeding 20 mhz  up to 100 mhz    carrier aggregation   of contiguous and noncontiguous spectrum allocations  local area optimization of   air interface    nomadic  local area network and mobility solutions  flexible   spectrum efficiencyspectrum usage      cognitive radio    automatic and autonomous network configuration and operation  support of autonomous network and device test  measurement tied to network management and optimization  enhanced   precoding   and   forward error correction    interference management and suppression  asymmetric bandwidth assignment for   frequencydivision duplex  frequencydivision duplexingfdd    hybrid   ofdma   and   scfdma   in uplink  uldl inter   node benb   coordinated mimo    selforganizing networksons    self organizing networks methodologies within the range of system development  lteadvanced and wimax 2 can use up to 8x8   mimo   and 128   qam   in downlink direction  example performance  100 mhz aggregated bandwidth  lteadvanced provides almost 33 gbit peak download rates per sector of the base station under ideal conditions  advanced network architectures combined with distributed and collaborative smart antenna technologies provide several years road map of commercial enhancements  the   3gpp   standards release 12 added support for 256qam  a summary of a study carried out in 3gpp can be found in tr36912  ref  3gpp technical report  feasibility study for further advancements for eutra  lte advanced   ref
