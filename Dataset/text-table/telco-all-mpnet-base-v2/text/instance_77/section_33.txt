Title: Unlicensed spectrum

Value:
normally  any intentional radio transmission requires an fcc license pursuant to title iii  however  in recent decades the fcc has also opened some spectrum bands for unlicensed operations  typically restricting them to low power levels conducive to shortrange applications  this has facilitated the development of a very wide range of common technologies from wireless garage door openers  cordless phones  and baby monitors to wifi and bluetooth among others  however  unlicensed devices  like most radio transmission equipment  must still receive technical approval from the fcc before being sold into the marketplace  including ensuring that such devices can not be modified by end users to increase transmit power above fcc limits
