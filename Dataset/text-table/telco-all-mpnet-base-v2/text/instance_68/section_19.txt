Title: Transmitter power

Value:
compared to cell phones and similar technology  wifi transmitters are lowpower devices  in general  the maximum amount of power that a wifi device can transmit is limited by local regulations  such   title 47 cfr part 15fcc part 15   in the us    equivalent isotropically radiated power    eirp  in the   european union   is limited to 20   dbm    100 mw   to reach requirements for wireless lan applications  wifi has higher power consumption compared to some other standards designed to support wireless personal area network  pan  applications  for example  bluetooth provides a much shorter   radio propagationpropagation   range between 1 and 100 metres  1 and 100 yards   ref    cite weburlhttps  janmagnetfileswordpresscom200807comparisonieee802standardspdftitlecomparison of the ieee 80211  802151802154  and 802156 wireless standardslasttjensvoldfirstjan magnedate18 september 2007archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20130720054917http  janmagnetfileswordpresscom200807comparisonieee802standardspdfarchivedate20 july 2013urlstatusliveaccessdate26 april 2013   section 12  scope   ref  and so in general has a lower power consumption  other lowpower technologies such   zigbee   have fairly long range  but much lower data rate  the high power consumption of wifi makes battery life in some mobile devices a concern
