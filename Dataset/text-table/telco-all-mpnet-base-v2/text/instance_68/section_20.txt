Title: Antenna

Value:
an access point compliant with either   ieee 80211  80211b80211b   or 80211g  using the stock   omnidirectional antenna   might have a range of   convert100mmilesabbron    the same radio with an external semi parabolic antenna  15 db gain  with a similarly equipped receiver at the far end might have a range over 20 miles  higher gain rating  dbi  indicates further deviation  generally toward the horizontal  from a theoretical  perfect   isotropic radiator    and therefore the antenna can project or accept a usable signal further in particular directions  compared to a similar output power a more isotropic antenna  ref    cite weburlhttp  wwwdslreportscomforumr15405199somebodyexplaindbititlesomebody explain dbi  wireless networking workdsl reports forums urlstatuslivearchiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20140809101928http  wwwdslreportscomforumr15405199somebodyexplaindbiarchivedate9 august 2014    ref  for example  an 8 dbi antenna used with a 100 mw driver has a similar horizontal range to a 6 dbi antenna being driven at 500 mw  this assumes that radiation in the vertical is lost  this may not be the case in some situations  especially in large buildings or within a   waveguide    in the above example  a directional waveguide could cause the lowpower 6 dbi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dbi antenna  which is not in a waveguide  even if they are both driven at 100 mw  wireless routers with detachable antennas  it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas that provide a higher gain in particular directions  outdoor ranges can be improved to many kilometres  miles  through the use of high gain   directional antenna   at the router and remote device
