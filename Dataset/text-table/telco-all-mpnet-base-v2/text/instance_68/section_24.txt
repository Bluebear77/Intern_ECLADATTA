allocations can help minimize cochannel and adjacentchannel interference      file  cochannel wifi interference 01pngthumbin the 24 ghz wavebands well others  transmitters straddle multiple channels  overlapping channels can suffer from interference unless this is a small portion of the total received power    wifi connections can be blocked or the internet speed lowered by having other devices in the same area  wifi protocols are designed to share the wavebands reasonably fairly  and this often works with little to no disruption  to minimize collisions with wifi and nonwifi devices  wifi employs   carriersense multiple access with collision avoidance    csmaca   where transmitters listen before transmitting and delay transmission of packets if they detect that other devices are active the channel  or if noise is detected from adjacent channels or nonwifi sources  nevertheless  wifi networks are still susceptible to the   hidden node   and   exposed node problem     ref    cite

that channels 1  6  and 11 are the only nonoverlapping channels is  therefore  not accurate  channels 1  6  and 11 are the only group of three nonoverlapping channels in north america  however  whether the overlap is significant depends physical spacing  channels that are four apart interfere a negligible amount   snd   much less than reusing channels  which causes   cochannel interference
