Title: Throughput

Value:
various layer2 variants of ieee 80211 have different characteristics  across all flavours of 80211  maximum achievable throughputs are either given based measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer2 data rates  this  however  does not apply to typical deployments in which data are transferred between two endpoints of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure  and the other is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link  this means that typically data frames pass an 80211  wlan  medium and are being converted to 8023  ethernet  or vice versa  due to the difference in the frame  header  lengths of these two media  the packet size of an application determines the speed of the data transfer  this means that an application that uses small packets  eg  voip  creates a data flow with high overhead traffic  low   goodput     other factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets  ie  the data rate  and the energy with which the wireless signal is received  the latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices  ref    cite conference titletowards energyawareness in managing wireless lan applications urlhttps  wwwresearchgatenetpublication241631429 publisherieeeifip noms date2012 conferenceieeeifip network operations and management symposium accessdate11 august 2014 archivedate13 august 2014 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20140813094612http  wwwresearchgatenetpublication241631429_towards_energyawareness_in_managing_wireless_lan_applications  evprf_pub urlstatuslive    ref   ref    cite web titleapplication level energy and performance measurements in a wireless lan urlhttps  wwwresearchgatenetpublication224264522 publisherthe 2011 ieeeacm international conference green computing and communications accessdate11 august 2014 archivedate13 august 2014 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20140813113706http  wwwresearchgatenetpublication224264522_application_level_energy_and_performance_measurements_in_a_wireless_lan  evprf_pub urlstatuslive    ref  the same references apply to the attached throughput graphs  which show measurements of   user datagram protocoludp   throughput measurements  each represents an average throughput of 25 measurements  the error bars are there  but barely visible due to the small variation   is with specific packet size  small or large   and with a specific data rate  10 kbits  100 mbits   markers for traffic profiles of common applications are included well  this text and measurements do not cover packet errors but information about this can be found at the above references  the table below shows the maximum achievable  applicationspecific  udp throughput in the same scenarios  same references again  with various wlan  80211  flavours  the measurement hosts have been 25 metres  yards  apart from each other  loss is again ignored
