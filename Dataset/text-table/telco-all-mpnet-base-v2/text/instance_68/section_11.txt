Title: Operational principles

Value:
wifi stations communicate by sending each other   data packet    blocks of data individually sent and delivered over radio  with all radio  this is done by the   modemmodulation and demodulation   of   carrier wave   different versions of wifi use different techniques  80211b uses   dsss   a single carrier  whereas 80211a  wifi 4  5 and 6 use multiple carriers slightly different frequencies within the channel    ofdm      ref  cisco systems  inc white paper capacity  coverage  and deployment considerations for ieee 80211g  ref   ref name  oreilly80211ac     cite web urlhttp  chimeralabsoreillycombooks1234000001739ch04html title80211ac  a survival guide publisherchimeralabsoreillycom accessdate17 april 2014 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20170703105148http  chimeralabsoreillycombooks1234000001739ch04html archivedate3 july 2017 urlstatusdead    ref  with other ieee 802 lans  stations come programmed with a globally unique 48bit mac address  often printed the equipment  so that each wifi station has a unique address    efnin some cases  the factoryassigned address can be overridden  either to avoid an address change when an adapter is replaced or to use   locally administered address      the mac addresses are used to specify both the destination and the source of each data packet  wifi establishes linklevel connections  which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses  the reception of a transmission  the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored  a network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other wifi stations    efnnamepromiscuousunless it is put into   promiscuous mode      channels are used   half duplex    ref    cite webdate23 january 2020titlewhy ca nt wifi work full duplex while 3g and 4g canurlhttps  communitymerakicomt5wirelesslanwhycantwifiworkasfullduplexwhile3gand4gcanmp74017  m11290accessdate19 september 2020websitecommunitymerakicomlanguageenarchivedate17 october 2021archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20211017103935https  communitymerakicomt5wirelesslanwhycantwifiworkasfullduplexwhile3gand4gcanmp74017  m11290urlstatuslive    ref   ref    cite webtitlebad info is nothing new for wlan do nt believe  full duplex  in wifi 6urlhttps  wwwtoolboxcomtechitstrategyblogsbadinfoisnothingnewforwlandontbelievefullduplexinwifi6082619accessdate19 september 2020websitetoolboxlanguageenusarchivedate19 november 2021archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20211119071542https  wwwtoolboxcomtechitstrategyblogsbadinfoisnothingnewforwlandontbelievefullduplexinwifi6082619urlstatuslive    ref  and can be   timedivision multiple accesstimeshared   by multiple networks  when communication happens the same channel  any information sent by one computer is locally received by all  even if that information is intended for just one destination    efnthis  one speaks  all listen  property is a security weakness of sharedmedium wifi since a node a wifi network can eavesdrop all traffic the wire if it so chooses    the network interface card interrupts the   central processing unitcpu   only when applicable packets are received  the card ignores information not addressed to it    efnnamepromiscuous   the use of the same channel also means that the data bandwidth is shared  such that  for example  available data bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are actively transmitting  a scheme known   carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance    csmaca  governs the way stations share channels  with csmaca stations attempt to avoid collisions by beginning transmission only after the channel is sensed to be  idle    ref name  federalstandard     cite web urlhttp  wwwitsbldrdocgovfs1037fs1037chtm titlefederal standard 1037c websiteitsbldrdocgov accessdate9 september 2012 archivedate2 march 2009 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20090302235918http  wwwitsbldrdocgovfs1037fs1037chtm urlstatusdead    ref   ref name  atis     cite web urlhttp  wwwatisorgtg2k titleamerican national standard t15232001  telecom glossary 2000 websiteatisorg accessdate9 september 2012 urlstatusdead archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20080302071329http  wwwatisorgtg2k archivedate2 march 2008    ref  but then transmit their packet data in its entirety  however  for geometric reasons  it can not completely prevent collisions  a collision happens when a station receives multiple signals a channel at the same time  this corrupts the transmitted data and can require stations to retransmit  the lost data and retransmission reduces throughput  in some cases severely
