Title: MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output)

Value:
  mainmimo   wifi 4 and higher standards allow devices to have multiple antennas transmitters and receivers  multiple antennas enable the equipment to exploit   multipath propagation   the same frequency bands giving much higher speeds and longer range  wifi 4 can more than double the range over previous standards  ref namewifiplanet    cite weburlhttp  wwwwifiplanetcomtutorialsarticlephp3680781 title80211n delivers better range date31 may 2007 workwifi planet urlstatusdead archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20151108080354http  wwwwifiplanetcomtutorialsarticlephp3680781 archivedate8 november 2015    ref  the wifi 5 standard uses the 5 ghz band exclusively  and is capable of multistation wlan throughput of at least 1 gigabit per second  and a single station throughput of at least 500 mbits  of the first quarter of 2016  the wifi alliance certifies devices compliant with the 80211ac standard  wifi certified ac   this standard uses several signal processing techniques such multiuser mimo and 4x4 spatial multiplexing streams  and wide channel bandwidth  160 mhz  to achieve its gigabit throughput  according to a study by ihs technology  70  of all access point sales revenue in the first quarter of 2016 came from 80211ac devices  ref    cite weburlhttps  wwwnetworkworldcomarticle308950880211acwifigeardrivingstrongwlanequipmentsaleshtmltitle80211ac wifi head driving strong wlan equipment saleslastgoldfirstjondate29 june 2016website   network world   archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20170827043858https  wwwnetworkworldcomarticle3089508mobilewireless80211acwifigeardrivingstrongwlanequipmentsaleshtmlarchivedate27 august 2017urlstatusliveaccessdate19 may 2017    ref
