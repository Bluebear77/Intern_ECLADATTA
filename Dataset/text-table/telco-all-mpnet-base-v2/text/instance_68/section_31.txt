Title: Repeater

Value:
wireless rangeextenders or   wireless repeater   can extend the range of an existing wireless network  strategically placed rangeextenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such those pertaining in lshaped corridors  wireless devices connected through repeaters suffer from an increased latency for each hop  and there may be a reduction in the maximum available data throughput  besides  the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless rangeextenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case whereby a single user migrates around a network employing extenders  for this reason  wireless rangeextenders work best in networks supporting low traffic throughput requirements  such for cases whereby a single user with a wifiequipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and nonextended portions of the total connected network  also  a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain has data throughput limited by the  weakest link  in the chain between the connection origin and connection end  networks using wireless extenders are more prone to degradation from interference from neighbouring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel the extended network
