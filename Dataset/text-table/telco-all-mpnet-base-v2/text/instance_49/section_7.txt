Title: Broadcast messages and paging

Value:
practically every cellular system has some kind of broadcast mechanism  this can be used directly for distributing information to multiple mobiles  commonly  for example in   mobile telephony   systems  the most important use of broadcast information is to set up channels for onetoone communication between the mobile transceiver and the base station  this is called paging  the three different paging procedures generally adopted are sequential  parallel and selective paging  the details of the process of paging vary somewhat from network to network  but normally we know a limited number of cells where the phone is located  this group of cells is called a location area in the   gsm   or   umts   system  or routing area if a data packet session is involved  in   3gpp long term evolutionlte    cells are grouped into tracking areas   paging takes place by sending the broadcast message to all of those cells  paging messages can be used for information transfer  this happens in   paging  telecommunications  pagers    in   cdma   systems for sending   short message servicesms   messages  and in the   umts   system where it allows for low downlink latency in packetbased connections
