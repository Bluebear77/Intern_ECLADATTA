Title: Frequency reuse

Value:
the key characteristic of a cellular network is the ability to reuse frequencies to increase both coverage and capacity  described above  adjacent cells must use different frequencies  however  there is no problem with two cells sufficiently far apart operating the same frequency  provided the masts and cellular network users  equipment do not transmit with too much power  ref namezander  the elements that determine frequency reuse are the reuse distance and the reuse factor  the reuse distance  is calculated   math  drsqrt  3n   math   where r is the cell radius and is the number of cells per cluster  cells may vary in radius from   convert1to30km    the boundaries of the cells can also overlap between adjacent cells and large cells can be divided into smaller cells  ref   e flood  telecommunication networks  institution of electrical engineers  london  uk  1997 chapter 12  ref  the frequency reuse factor is the rate at which the same frequency can be used in the network  it is 1k  or k according to some books  where k is the number of cells which can not use the same frequencies for transmission  common values for the frequency reuse factor are 13  14  17  19 and 112  or 3  4  7  9 and 12  depending notation    ref    cite weburlhttp  wwwthereversephonecomphonenetworksphonenetworkstitlephone networksdate8 june 2011publisherthe reverse phoneaccessdate2 april 2012archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20120430205327http  wwwthereversephonecomphonenetworksphonenetworks  archivedate30 april 2012urlstatusdeaddfdmyall    ref  in case of sector antennas the same base station site  each with different direction  the base station site can serve different sectors  is typically 3  a reuse pattern of nk denotes a further division in frequency among sector antennas per site  some current and historical reuse patterns are 37  north american amps   64  motorola namps   and 34    gsm     if the total available   bandwidth  signal processing  bandwidth   is b  each cell can only use a number of frequency channels corresponding to a bandwidth of bk  and each sector can use a bandwidth of bnk    codedivision multiple access   based systems use a wider frequency band to achieve the same rate of transmission fdma  but this is compensated for by the ability to use a frequency reuse factor of 1  for example using a reuse pattern of 11  in other words  adjacent base station sites use the same frequencies  and the different base stations and users are separated by codes rather than frequencies  while is shown 1 in this example  that does not mean the cdma cell has only one sector  but rather that the entire cell bandwidth is also available to each sector individually  recently also   orthogonal frequencydivision multiple access   based systems such   3gpp long term evolutionlte   are being deployed with a frequency reuse of 1  since such systems do not spread the signal across the frequency band  intercell radio resource management is important to coordinate resource allocation between different cell sites and to limit the intercell interference  there are various means of   intercell interference coordination    icic  already defined in the standard  ref    cite weburlhttp  wwwnomordeuploadsa481a4815c4dc585be33c81f0ec7a15deed7201012whitepaper_lte_hetnet_icicpdftitleheterogeneous lte networks and intercell interference coordinationlastpaulifirstvolkerauthor2naranjo  juan diegoauthor3seidel  eikodatedecember 2010publishernomor researchaccessdate2 april 2012archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20130903122150http  wwwnomordeuploadsa481a4815c4dc585be33c81f0ec7a15deed7201012whitepaper_lte_hetnet_icicpdf  archivedate3 september 2013urlstatusdeaddfdmyall    ref  coordinated scheduling  multisite mimo or multisite beamforming are other examples for intercell radio resource management that might be standardized in the future
