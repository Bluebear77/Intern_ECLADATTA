Title: Cellular handover in mobile phone networks

Value:
  mainhandover   the phone user moves from one cell area to another cell while a call is in progress  the mobile station will search for a new channel to attach to in order not to drop the call  once a new channel is found  the network will command the mobile unit to switch to the new channel and at the same time switch the call onto the new channel  with   cdma    multiple cdma handsets share a specific radio channel  the signals are separated by using a   pseudorandom noisepseudonoise   code  pn code  that is specific to each phone  the user moves from one cell to another  the handset sets up radio links with multiple cell sites  or sectors of the same site  simultaneously  this is known  soft handoff  because  unlike with traditional   cellular technology    there is no one defined point where the phone switches to the new cell  in   is95   interfrequency handovers and older analog systems such   nordic mobile telephonenmt   it will typically be impossible to test the target channel directly while communicating  in this case  other techniques have to be used such pilot beacons in is95  this means that there is almost always a brief break in the communication while searching for the new channel followed by the risk of an unexpected return to the old channel  if there is no ongoing communication or the communication can be interrupted  it is possible for the mobile unit to spontaneously move from one cell to another and then notify the base station with the strongest signal
