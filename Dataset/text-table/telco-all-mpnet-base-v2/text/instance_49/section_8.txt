Title: Movement from cell to cell and handing over

Value:
in a primitive taxi system  when the taxi moved away from a first tower and closer to a second tower  the taxi driver manually switched from one frequency to another needed  if communication was interrupted due to a loss of a signal  the taxi driver asked the base station operator to repeat the message a different frequency  in a cellular system  the distributed mobile transceivers move from cell to cell during an ongoing continuous communication  switching from one cell frequency to a different cell frequency is done electronically without interruption and without a base station operator or manual switching  this is called the   handover   or handoff  typically  a new channel is automatically selected for the mobile unit the new base station which will serve it  the mobile unit then automatically switches from the current channel to the new channel and communication continues  the exact details of the mobile system move from one base station to the other vary considerably from system to system  see the example below for how a mobile phone network manages handover
