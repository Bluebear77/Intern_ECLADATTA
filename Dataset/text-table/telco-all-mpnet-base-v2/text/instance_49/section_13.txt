Title: Cellular frequency choice in mobile phone networks

Value:
  maincellular frequencies   the effect of frequency cell coverage means that different frequencies serve better for different uses  low frequencies  such 450 mhz nmt  serve very well for countryside coverage    gsm   900  900 mhz  is suitable for light urban coverage    gsm   1800  18 ghz  starts to be limited by structural walls    umts    at 21 ghz is quite similar in coverage to   gsm   1800  higher frequencies are a disadvantage when it comes to coverage  but it is a decided advantage when it comes to capacity  picocells  covering eg  one floor of a building  become possible  and the same frequency can be used for cells which are practically neighbors  cell service area may also vary due to interference from transmitting systems  both within and around that cell  this is true especially in cdma based systems  the receiver requires a certain   signaltonoise ratio    and the transmitter should not send with too high transmission power in view to not cause interference with other transmitters  the receiver moves away from the transmitter  the power received decreases  so the   power control   algorithm of the transmitter increases the power it transmits to restore the level of received power  the interference  noise  rises above the received power from the transmitter  and the power of the transmitter can not be increased anymore  the signal becomes corrupted and eventually unusable  in   cdmabased systems    the effect of interference from other mobile transmitters in the same cell coverage area is very marked and has a special name    cell breathing  telephony  cell breathing    one can see examples of cell coverage by studying some of the coverage maps provided by real operators their web sites or by looking at independently crowdsourced maps such   opensignal   or   cellmapper    in certain cases they may mark the site of the transmitter  in others  it can be calculated by working out the point of strongest coverage  a   cellular repeater   is used to extend cell coverage into larger areas  they range from wideband repeaters for consumer use in homes and offices to smart or digital repeaters for industrial needs
