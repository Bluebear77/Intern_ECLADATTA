Title: Cell signal encoding

Value:
to distinguish signals from several different transmitters    frequencydivision multiple access    fdma  used by analog and   damps     citation neededdatenovember 2019   systems     timedivision multiple access    tdma  used by   gsm    and   codedivision multiple access    cdma  first used for   personal communications servicepcs    and the basis of   3g    were developed  ref namezander  with fdma  the transmitting and receiving frequencies used by different users in each cell are different from each other  each cellular call was assigned a pair of frequencies  one for base to mobile  the other for mobile to base  to provide   fullduplex   operation  the original   advanced mobile phone serviceamps   systems had 666 channel pairs  333 each for the   competitive local exchange carrierclec    a  system and   incumbent local exchange carrierilec    b  system  the number of channels was expanded to 416 pairs per carrier  but ultimately the number of rf channels limits the number of calls that a cell site could handle  fdma is a familiar technology to telephone companies  which used   frequencydivision multiplexing   to add channels to their pointtopoint wireline plants before   timedivision multiplexing   rendered fdm obsolete  with tdma  the transmitting and receiving time slots used by different users in each cell are different from each other  tdma typically uses   digital datadigital   signaling to   store and forward   bursts of voice data that are fit into time slices for transmission  and expanded at the receiving end to produce a somewhat normalsounding voice at the receiver  tdma must introduce   latency  audio  latency    time delay  into the audio signal  long the latency time is short enough that the delayed audio is not heard an echo  it is not problematic  tdma is a familiar technology for telephone companies  which used   timedivision multiplexing   to add channels to their pointtopoint wireline plants before   packet switching   rendered fdm obsolete  the principle of cdma is based   spread spectrum   technology developed for military use during   world war ii   and improved during the   cold war   into   directsequence spread spectrum   that was used for early cdma cellular systems and   wifi    dsss allows multiple simultaneous phone conversations to take place a single wideband rf channel  without needing to channelize them in time or frequency  although more sophisticated than older multiple access schemes  and unfamiliar to legacy telephone companies because it was not developed by   bell labs     cdma has scaled well to become the basis for 3g cellular radio systems  other available methods of multiplexing such   mimo    a more sophisticated version of   antenna diversity    combined with active   beamforming   provides much greater   spatial multiplexing   ability compared to original amps cells  that typically only addressed one to three unique spaces  massive mimo deployment allows much greater channel reuse  thus increasing the number of subscribers per cell site  greater data throughput per user  or some combination thereof    quadrature amplitude modulation    qam  modems offer an increasing number of bits per symbol  allowing more users per megahertz of bandwidth  and decibels of snr   greater data throughput per user  or some combination thereof
