Title: Multipoint control

Value:
  mainmultipoint control unit   simultaneous videoconferencing among three or more remote points is possible in a hardwarebased system by means of a   multipoint control unit    mcu   this is a bridge that interconnects calls from several sources  in a similar way to the audio conference call   all parties call the mcu  or the mcu can also call the parties which are going to participate  in sequence  there are mcu bridges for ip and isdnbased videoconferencing  there are mcus which are pure software and others that are a combination of hardware and software  an mcu is characterized according to the number of simultaneous calls it can handle  its ability to conduct transposing of data rates and protocols  and features such continuous presence  in which multiple parties can be seen onscreen at once  mcus can be standalone hardware devices  or they can be embedded into dedicated videoconferencing units  the mcu consists of two logical components   a single multipoint controller  mc   and  multipoint processors  mp   sometimes referred to the mixer  the mc controls the conferencing while it is active the signaling plane  which is simply where the system manages conferencing creation  endpoint signaling and inconferencing controls  this component negotiates parameters with every endpoint in the network and controls conferencing resources  while the mc controls resources and signaling negotiations  the mp operates the media plane and receives media from each endpoint  the mp generates output streams from each endpoint and redirects the information to other endpoints in the conference  some systems are capable of multipoint conferencing with no mcu  standalone  embedded or otherwise  these use a standardsbased h323 technique known decentralized multipoint  where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central manager or other bottleneck  the advantages of this technique are that the video and audio will generally be of higher quality because they do not have to be relayed through a central point  also  users can make ad hoc multipoint calls without any concern for the availability or control of an mcu  this added convenience and quality comes at the expense of some increased network bandwidth  because every station must transmit to every other station directly  ref name  v  vcf
