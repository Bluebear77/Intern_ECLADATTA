Title: By cost and quality of service

Value:
from the least to the most expensive systems     webcamweb camera   videophone and videoconferencing systems  either standalone or builtin  that serve complements to personal computers  connected to other participants by   computer networkcomputer   and   voip   networkslowest direct cost  assuming the users already possess computers at their respective locations  quality of service can range from low to very high  including   highdefinition videohigh definition   video available the latest model webcams  a related and similar device is a tv camera which is usually small  sits top of a tv  and can connect to it via its   hdmi   port  similar to how a webcam attaches to a computer via a usb port     videophone   slow to midrange cost  the earliest standalone models operated over either   plain old telephone service    pots  lines the   pstn   telephone networks or more expensive   isdn   lines  while newer models have largely migrated to   internet protocol   line service for higher image resolutions and sound quality  quality of service for standalone videophones can vary from low to high   huddle room or allinone systems low to midrange cost  newer endpoint category based standard videoconferencing systems  but defined by the camera  microphone    speakers  and codec contained in a single piece of hardware  typically used in small to medium spaces where   beamforming     microphone array   located in the system are sufficient  in lieu of table or ceiling microphones in closer proximity to the inroom participants  quality of service is comparable to standard videoconferencing systems  varying from moderate to high  some manufacturers  huddle room systems do not include the codec within the soundbarshaped unit  rather only camera  microphone  and speakers  these systems are usually still classified huddle room systems  but  like webcams  rely a usb connection to an external device  usually a pc  to process the video codec responsibilities  despite its name  video conferencing systems for huddle rooms prevent participants from huddling close together to be seen in the camera  allinone systems for these types of rooms range from wide angles such 110 horizontal field of view  fov  to much 360 fov that allow a full view of the room     videoconferencingvideoconferencing systems   midrange cost  usually using   multipoint control unit   or other bridging services to allow multiple parties videoconference calls  quality of service can vary from moderate to high     telepresencetelepresence systems   highest capabilities and highest cost  full highend systems can involve specially built teleconference rooms to allow expansive views with very high levels of audio and video fidelity  to permit an immersive  videoconference  when the proper type and capacity transmission lines are provided between facilities  the quality of service reaches stateoftheart levels
