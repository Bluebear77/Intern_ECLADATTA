for over a century    futurist   have envisioned a future where telephone conversations will take place actual facetoface encounters with video well audio  sometimes it is simply not possible or practical to have facetoface meetings with two or more people  sometimes a telephone conversation or conference call is adequate  other times    email   exchanges are adequate  however  videoconferencing adds another option and can be considered when   a live conversation is needed  nonverbal  visual  information is an important component of the conversation  the parties of the conversation can not physically come to the same location  the expense or time of travel is a consideration   bill gates   said in 2001 that he used videoconferencing  three or four times a year   because digital scheduling was difficult and  if the overhead is super high  then you might well just have a facetoface meeting    ref name  millergates20010904     cite interview lastgates firstbill

cooperative work  2002  ref  while traditional telephone conversations give no eye contact cues  many videoconferencing systems are arguably worse in that they provide an incorrect impression that the remote interlocutor is avoiding eye contact  some telepresence systems have cameras located in the screens that reduce the amount of   parallax   observed by the users  this issue is also being addressed through research that generates a synthetic image with eye contact using stereo reconstruction  ref  computer vision approaches to achieving eye contact appeared in the 1990s  such

second psychological problem with videoconferencing is being camera  with the video stream possibly even being recorded  the burden of presenting an acceptable onscreen appearance is not present in

technologies such   adsl   are usually provided two separate lines  for uplinkdownlink  because each has limited upload speeds and can not upload and download simultaneously at full speed  internet speeds increase  higher quality and highdefinition videoconferencing will become more readily available   complexity of systems  most users are not technically experienced and want a simple interface  in hardware systems  an unplugged cord or an unresponsive remote control is seen a failure  contributing to a perceived unreliability  successful systems are backed by support teams who can provide fast assistance when required   perceived lack of interoperability  not all systems can readily interconnect  for example  isdn and ip systems require a gateway  popular software solutions can not easily connect to hardware systems  some systems use different standards  features  and qualities which can require additional configuration when connecting to dissimilar systems  free software systems circumvent this limitation by making it relatively easy for a single user to communicate over multiple incompatible platforms   expense of commercial systems  welldesigned   telepresence   systems require specially designed rooms which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fit out their rooms with codecs  integration equipment  such   multipoint control unit     high fidelity sound systems  and furniture  monthly charges may also be required for bridging services and highcapacity broadband service  these are some of the reasons many organizations only use the systems internally  where there is less risk of loss of customers  an alternative for those lacking dedicated facilities is the   list of video telecommunication services and product brands  public

prearranged and support being readily available if needed  the issue of eye contact may be solved with advancing technology  including smartphones which have the screen and camera in essentially the same place  in developed countries  the nearubiquity of   smartphone      tablet computer    and computers with builtin audio and webcams removes the need for expensive dedicated hardware
