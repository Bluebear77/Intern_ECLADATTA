Title: Conferencing layers

Value:
the components within a videoconferencing system can be divided up into several different layers  user interface  conference control  control or signaling plane  and media plane  videoconferencing user interfaces  vui  can be either graphical or voiceresponsive  many in the industry have encountered both types of interface  and normally a graphical interface is encountered a computer  user interfaces for conferencing have a number of different uses  they can be used for scheduling  setup  and making a video call  through the user interface  the administrator is able to control the other three layers of the system  conference control performs resource allocation  management  and routing  this layer along with the user interface creates meetings  scheduled or unscheduled  or adds and removes participants from a conference  control  signaling  plane contains the stacks that signal different endpoints to create a call andor a conference  signals can be  but are not limited to    h323   and   session initiation protocol    sip  protocols  these signals control incoming and outgoing connections well session parameters  the media plane controls the audio and video mixing and streaming  this layer manages realtime transport protocols  user datagram packets  udp  and   rtp control protocolrealtime transport control protocol    rtcp   the rtp and udp normally carry information such the payload type which is the type of codec  frame rate  video size  and many others  rtcp the other hand acts a quality control protocol for detecting errors during streaming  ref name  v  vcf
