Title: Dual-Carrier HSDPA (DC-HSDPA)

Value:
dualcarrier hsdpa  also known dualcell hsdpa  is part of   3gpp   release 8 specification  it is the natural evolution of hspa by means of   carrier aggregation   in the downlink  umts licenses are often issued 5  10  or 20 mhz paired spectrum allocations  the basic idea of the multicarrier feature is to achieve better resource utilization and spectrum efficiency by means of joint resource allocation and load balancing across the downlink carriers  ref name  nomor 1     cite web urlhttp  wwwnomordehometechnologywhitepapersdualcellhspaanditsfutureevolution titledualcell hspa and its future evolution  nomor research publishernomor date20101010 accessdate20160330 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20140201161319http  wwwnomordehometechnologywhitepapersdualcellhspaanditsfutureevolution archivedate20140201 urlstatusdead    ref  new hsdpa   highspeed downlink packet access  user equipment  ue  categoriesuser equipment categories 2124   have been introduced that support dchsdpa  dchsdpa can support up to 422 mbits  but unlike hspa  it does not need to rely mimo transmission  the support of mimo in combination with dchsdpa will allow operators deploying release 7 mimo to benefit from the dchsdpa functionality defined in release 8  while in release 8 dchsdpa can only operate adjacent carriers  release 9 also allows that the paired cells can operate two different frequency bands  later releases allow the use of up to four carriers simultaneously  from release 9 onwards it will be possible to use dchsdpa in combination with mimo being used both carriers  the support of mimo in combination with dchsdpa will allow operators even more capacity improvements within their network  this will allow theoretical speed of up to 844 mbits  ref name  nomor 2     cite web urlhttp  wwwnomordehometechnology3gppnewsletter200903standardisationupdatesonhspaevolution title200903  standardisation updates hspa evolution  nomor research publishernomor date20101010 accessdate20160330 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20140201161322http  wwwnomordehometechnology3gppnewsletter200903standardisationupdatesonhspaevolution archivedate20140201 urlstatusdead    ref   ref    cite web urlhttp  wwwradioelectronicscominfocellulartelecomms3ghspadcdualcarrierhspahsdpaphp titledual carrier hspa  dchspa  dchspda accessdate20160314 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20181120055200https  wwwradioelectronicscominfocellulartelecomms3ghspadcdualcarrierhspahsdpaphp archivedate20181120 urlstatusdead    ref
