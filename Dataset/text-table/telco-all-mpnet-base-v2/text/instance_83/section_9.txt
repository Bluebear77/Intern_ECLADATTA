Title: Multi-carrier HSPA (MC-HSPA)

Value:
the aggregation of more than two carriers has been studied and   3gpp   release 11 is scheduled to include 4carrier hspa  the standard was scheduled to be finalised in q3 2012 and first chipsets supporting mchspa in late 2013  release 11 specifies 8carrier hspa allowed in noncontiguous bands with 4  4   mimo   offering peak transfer rates up to   nowrap672 mbits    the 168 mbits and 22 mbits represent theoretical peak speeds  the actual speed for a user will be lower  in general  hspa offers higher bitrates only in very good radio conditions  very close to the cell tower  or if the terminal and network both support either   mimo   or   dualcell hsdpa    which effectively use two parallel transmit channels with different technical implementations  the higher 168 mbits speeds are achieved by using multiple carriers with   dualcell hsdpa   and 4way   mimo   together simultaneously  ref name  ericsson     cite weburlhttp  wwwericssoncomresthecompanydocsjournal_conference_papersatspmulticarrier_hspa_evolutionpdfdate28 january 2009titlemulticarrier hspa evolutionauthor1klas johanssonauthor2johan bergmanauthor3dirk gerstenbergerauthor4mats blomgrenauthor5anders wall√©npublisherericssoncomaccessdate20140601archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20130526034623http  wwwericssoncomresthecompanydocsjournal_conference_papersatspmulticarrier_hspa_evolutionpdfarchivedate26 may 2013urlstatusdead    ref   ref name  nokiasiemensnetworks     cite weburlhttp  wwwnokiasiemensnetworkscomsitesdefaultfilesdocumenthspa_evolution_white_paper_low_res_141220pdfdate14 december 2010titlewhite paper long term hspa evolution mobile broadband evolution beyond 3gpp release 10publishernokiaslemensnetworkscomaccessdate20140601    ref
