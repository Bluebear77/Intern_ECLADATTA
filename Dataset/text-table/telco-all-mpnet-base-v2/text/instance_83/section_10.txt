Title: All-IP architecture

Value:
a flattened allip architecture is an option for the network within hspa  in this architecture  the base stations connect to the network via ip  often ethernet providing the transmission   bypassing legacy elements for the user data connections  this makes the network faster and cheaper to deploy and operate  the legacy architecture is still permitted with the evolved hspa and is likely to exist for several years after adoption of the other aspects of hspa  higher order modulation  multiple streams  etc   this flat architecture  connects the user plane  directly from the base station to the   ggsn   external gateway  using any available link technology supporting tcpip  the definition can be found in 3gpp tr25999  the user data flow bypasses the radio network controller  rnc  and the   sgsn   of the previous 3gpp umts architecture versions  thus simplifying the architecture  reducing costs and delays  this is nearly identical to the   3gpp long term evolution    lte  flat architecture defined in the 3gpp standard rel8  the changes allow cost effective modern link layer technologies such xdsl or ethernet  and these technologies are no longer tied to the more expensive and rigid requirements of the older standard of sonetsdh and e1t1 infrastructure  there are no changes to the control plane     nokia siemens networks   internet hspa  ihspa  was the first commercial solution implementing the evolved hspa flattened allip architecture  ref    webarchive urlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20110102060653http  wwwnokiasiemensnetworkscomproductsmobilebroadbandinternethspa datejanuary 2  2011    ref
