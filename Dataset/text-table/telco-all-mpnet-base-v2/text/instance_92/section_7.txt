Title: EV-DO Rev. B (TIA-856 Revision B)

Value:
evdo rev  b is a multicarrier evolution of the rev  a specification  it maintains the capabilities of evdo rev  a  and provides the following enhancements   higher rates per   carrier signalcarrier    up to 49 mbits the downlink per carrier   typical deployments are expected to include 2 or 3 carriers for a peak rate of 147 mbits  higher rates by bundling multiple channels together enhance the user experience and enable new services such   highdefinition videohigh definition     video streaming     reduced latency by using   statistical multiplexing   across channelsenhances the experience for latency sensitive services such gaming  video telephony  remote console sessions and web browsing   increased talktime and standby time  reduced interference from the adjacent sectors especially to users at the edge of the cell signal which improves the rates that can be offered by using hybrid frequency reuse   efficient support for services that have asymmetric download and upload requirements  ie  different data rates required in each direction  such file transfers  web browsing  and broadband multimedia content delivery   evdo rev   tia856 revision  and tia1121  qualcomm early realized

such voice built top  widespread deployment of 4g networks promises to make applications that were previously not feasible not only possible but ubiquitous  examples of such applications include mobile   highdefinition televisionhigh definition video   streaming and mobile gaming  like lte  the umb system was to be based upon internet networking technologies running over a next generation radio system  with peak rates of up to 280 mbits  its designers intended for the system to be more efficient and capable of providing more services than the technologies it was intended to replace  to provide compatibility with the systems it was intended to replace  umb was to support handoffs with other technologies including existing cdma2000 1x and 1xevdo systems  umb use of ofdma would have eliminated many of the disadvantages of the cdma technology used by its predecessor  including the  breathing  phenomenon  the difficulty of adding capacity via microcells  the fixed bandwidth sizes that limit the total bandwidth available to handsets  and the near complete control by one company of the required intellectual property  while capacity of existing rel  b networks can be increased
