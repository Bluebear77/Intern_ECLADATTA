Title: Reverse link structure

Value:
the reverse link  from the mobile back to the   base transceiver station    evdo rel  0 operates very similar to that of   cdma2000cdma2000 1xrtt    the channel includes a reverse link pilot  helps with decoding the signal  along with the user data channels  some additional channels that do not exist in 1x include the drc channel  described above  and the ack channel  used for   hybrid automatic repeatrequestharq     only the reverse link has any sort of   power control    because the forward link is always transmitted at full power for use by all the mobiles  ref name  lucent    the reverse link has both open loop and closed loop power control  in the open loop  the reverse link transmission power is set based upon the received power the forward link  in the closed loop  the reverse link power is adjusted up or down 800 times a second  indicated by the serving sector  similar to   cdma20001x      ref  cdg  advantages of cdma2000   webarchive urlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20081023022338http  wwwcdgorgtechnology3gadvantages_cdma2000asp dateoctober 23  2008    ref  all of the reverse link channels are combined using   codedivision multiple accesscode division   and transmitted back to the base station using   bpsk    ref    cite weburlhttp  rfmwemkeysightcomrfcommsrefdocs1xevdo1xevdo_gen_rtap_ratehtmltitlertap rateworkkeysightcomaccessdate14 august 2015    ref  where they are decoded  the maximum speed available for user data is 1532 kbits  but in reallife conditions this is rarely achieved  typical speeds achieved are between 2050 kbits
