Title: EV-DO Rev. A (TIA-856 Revision A)

Value:
revision a of evdo makes several additions to the protocol while keeping it completely backwards compatible with release 0  these changes included the introduction of several new forward link data rates that increase the maximum burst rate from 245 mbits to 31 mbits  also included were protocols that would decrease connection establishment time  called enhanced access channel mac   the ability for more than one mobile to share the same timeslot  multiuser packets  and the introduction of   quality of serviceqos   flags  all of these were put in place to allow for low latency  low bit rate communications such   voice over internet protocolvoip     ref namegopal     cite book firstthawatt  lastgopal title2007 ieee wireless communications and networking conference chapterevdo rev  a control channel bandwidth analysis for paging publisherieee pages32627 date1115 march 2007 doi 101109wcnc2007601 isbn9781424406586 s2cid15430071    ref  the additional forward rates for evdo rev  an are   ref name  revastandard     cite web urlhttp  www3gpp2orgpublic_htmlspecscs0024a_v20_050727pdf titlecdma2000 high rate packet data air interface accessdate20080118 datejuly 2005 publisher   3gpp2   pages10114 archiveurlhttps  webarchiveorgweb20080216101310http  www3gpp2orgpublic_htmlspecscs0024a_v20_050727pdf archivedate20080216 urlstatusdead    ref  in addition to the changes the forward link  the reverse link was enhanced to support higher complexity   modulation    and thus higher bit rates   an optional secondary pilot was added  which is activated by the mobile when it tries to achieve enhanced data rates  to combat reverse link congestion and noise rise  the protocol calls for each mobile to be given an interference allowance which is replenished by the network when the reverse link conditions allow it  ref name  revastandard    the reverse link has a maximum rate of 18 mbits  but under normal conditions users experience a rate of approximately 5001000 kbits but with more   relationship between latency and throughputlatency   than   docsis   and   dsl
