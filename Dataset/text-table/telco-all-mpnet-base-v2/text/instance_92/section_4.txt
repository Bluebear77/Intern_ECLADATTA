Title: Forward link channel structure

Value:
the primary characteristic that differentiates an evdo channel from a 1xrtt channel is that it is   timedivision multiplexingtime multiplexed   the forward link  from the tower to the mobile   this means that a single mobile has full use of the forward traffic channel within a particular geographic area  a sector  during a given slot of time  using this technique  evdo is able to   digital modulation methodmodulate   each user  time slot independently  this allows the service of users in favorable rf conditions with very complex   modulation   techniques while also serving users in poor rf conditions with simpler  and more redundant  signals  ref name  performance     cite journal first1qi last1bi author2s  vitebsky titleperformance analysis of 3g1x evdo high data rate system journalieee wireless communications and networking conference publisherieee pages389395 date1721 march 2002    ref  the forward channel is divided into slots  each being 1667 ms long  in addition to user traffic  overhead channels are interlaced into the stream  which include the pilot   which helps the mobile find and identify the channel  the   mac addressmedia access channel  mac    which tells the mobile devices when their data is scheduled  and the control channel   which contains other information the network needs the mobile devices to know  the   modulation   to be used to communicate with a given mobile unit is determined by the mobile device itself  it listens to the traffic the channel  and depending the receive signal strength along with the perceived multipath and fading conditions  makes a best guess to what datarate it can sustain while maintaining a reasonable frame error rate of 12   it then communicates this information back to the serving sector in the form of an integer between 1 and 12 the  digital rate control   drc  channel  alternatively  the mobile can select a  null  rate  drc 0   indicating that the mobile either can not decode data at any rate  or that it is attempting to   handoffhand off   to another serving sector  ref name  performance    the drc values are follows   ref name  lucent     cite web urlhttp  wwwcdgorgresourceswhite_papersfileslucent  201xevdo  20rev  20o  20mar  2004pdf titlea forward link performance study of the 1xevdo rel  0 system using field measurements and simulations accessdate20080118 lastbi firstqi datemarch 2004 publisher   alcatellucentlucent technologies      ref  another important aspect of the evdo forward link channel is the scheduler  the scheduler most commonly used is called    proportional fair     it designed to maximize sector throughput while also guaranteeing each user a certain minimum level of service  the idea is to schedule mobiles reporting higher drc indices more often  with the hope that those reporting worse conditions will improve in time  the system also incorporates   hybrid automatic repeatrequestincremental redundancy hybrid arq    each subpacket of a multislot transmission is a   turbo codeturbocoded   replica of the original data bits  this allows mobiles to acknowledge a packet before all of its subsections have been transmitted  for example  if a mobile transmits a drc index of 3 and is scheduled to receive data  it will expect to get data during four time slots  if after decoding the first slot the mobile is able to determine the entire data packet  it can send an early acknowledgement back at that time  the remaining three subpackets will be cancelled  if however the packet is not acknowledged  the network will proceed with the transmission of the remaining parts until all have been transmitted or the packet is acknowledged  ref name  performance
