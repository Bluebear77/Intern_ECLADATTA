radio frequencies used for cellular networks differ in   itu region    americas  europe  africa and asia   the first commercial standard for mobile connection in the united states was   advanced mobile phone systemamps    which was in the 800 mhz frequency band  in nordic countries of   europe    the first widespread automatic mobile network was based the   nordic mobile telephonenmt450 standard    which was in the 450 mhz band  mobile phones became more popular and affordable  mobile providers encountered a problem because they could nt provide service to the increasing number of customers  they had to develop their existing networks and eventually introduce new standards  often based other frequencies  some european countries  and japan  adopted   tacs   operating in 900 mhz  the   gsm   standard  which appeared in europe to replace nmt450 and other standards  initially used the 900 mhz band too  demand grew  carriers acquired licenses in the 1800 mhz band   generally speaking  lower frequencies allow carriers to provide coverage over a larger area  while higher frequencies allow carriers to provide service to more customers in a smaller area   in the us  the analog amps standard that used the cellular band  800 mhz  was replaced by a number of digital systems  initially  systems based upon the amps mobile phone model were popular  including   is95    often known    codedivision multiple accesscdma     the   air interface   technology it uses  and   is136    often known damps  digital amps  or    timedivision multiple accesstdma     the air interface technology it uses   eventually  is136 these frequencies was replaced by most operators with gsm  gsm had already been running for some time us   personal communications servicepcs    1900 mhz  frequencies  and  some nmt450 analog networks have been replaced with digital networks using the same frequency  in russia and some other countries  local carriers received licenses for 450 mhz frequency to provide cdma mobile coverage area  many   gsm   phones support three bands  90018001900 mhz or 85018001900 mhz  or four bands  85090018001900 mhz   and are usually referred to   multibandtriband and quadband   phones  or   world phone    with such a phone one can travel internationally and use the same handset  this portability is not extensive with is95 phones  however  is95 networks do not exist in most of europe  mobile networks based different standards may use the same frequency range  for example  amps    damps      advanced mobile phone systemnamps   and is95 all use the 800 mhz frequency band  moreover  one can find both amps and is95 networks in use the same frequency in the same area that do not interfere with each other  this is achieved by the use of different channels to carry data  the actual frequency used by a particular phone can vary from place to place  depending the settings of the carrier base station
