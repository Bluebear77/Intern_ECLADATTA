Value:
this type of roaming refers to the ability to move to a foreign service provider network  it is  consequently  of particular interest to international tourists and business travelers  broadly speaking  international roaming is typically easiest when using the gsm standard  it is used by over 80  of the world mobile operators  and most devices support it  however  even then  there may be problems  since countries have allocated different frequency bands for gsm communications  there are two groups of countries  most gsm countries use 9001800 mhz  but the   united states   and some other countries in the americas have allocated 8501900 mhz   for a phone to work in a country with a different frequency allocation  it must support one or both of that country frequencies  and thus be   tri bandtri   or   quad band    if international roaming allows the traveler to stay connected during their trip  it can also generate significant costs for users  due to the trend of carriers pricing gsm usage internationally outrageously high if the traveler elects to not purchase an optional addon to their current phone service  in fact  the use of mobile networks outside its original country can lead to significant billing by its original mobile data operator without an addon to their current phone service  ref    cite newsurlhttps  wwwtelegraphcouktraveladvicehowtoavoiddataroamingchargestitlehow to avoid data roaming chargeslastporterfirstlizziedate20160204workthe telegraphaccessdate20180910languageengbissn03071235    ref
