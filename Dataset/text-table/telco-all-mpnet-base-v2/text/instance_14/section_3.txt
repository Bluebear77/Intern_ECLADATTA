Title: 1G and 2G

Value:
while some   analogue electronicsanalogue   mobile phones provided a standard   rj11  rj14  rj25rj11   telephone socket into which a normal landline modem could be plugged  this only provided slow   dialup   connections  usually 24 kilobit per second  kbits  or less  the next generation of phones  known 2g  for second generation    were digital  and offered faster dialup speeds of 96kbits or 144kbits without the need for a separate modem  a further evolution called   circuit switched data  high speed circuit switched data  hscsd  hscsd   used multiple gsm channels  two or three in each direction  to support up to 432kbits  all of these technologies still required their users to have a dialup   internet service providerisp   to connect to and provide the internet access  it was not provided by the mobile phone network itself  the release of   25g   phones with support for   packet  information technology  packet   data changed this  the 25g networks break both digital voice and data into small chunks  and mix both onto the network simultaneously in a process called   packet switching    this allows the phone to have a voice connection and a data connection at the same time  rather than a single channel that has to be used for one or the other  the network can link the data connection into a company network  but for most users the connection is to the internet  this allows web browsing the phone  but a pc can also tap into this service if it connects to the phone  the pc needs to send a special telephone number to the phone to get access to the packet data connection  from the pc viewpoint  the connection still looks like a normal ppp dialup link  but it is all terminating the phone  which then handles the exchange of data with the network  speeds 25g networks are usually in the 3050kbits range
