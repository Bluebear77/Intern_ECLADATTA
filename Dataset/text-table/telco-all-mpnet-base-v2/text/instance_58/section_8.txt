  see alsononionizing radiation   there is no known way in which radiofrequency radiation  in contrast to   ionizing radiation    affects dna and causes cancer  in 2011 the iarc  a   world health organization   working group  classified mobile phone use  possibly carcinogenic to humans    ref namewhocancer    cite web urlhttps  wwwwhointmediacentrefactsheetsfs193en titlefact sheet no  193

epidemiological evidence was mixed  several small early casecontrol studies were considered to be largely uninformative  a large cohort study showed no increase in risk of relevant tumours  but it lacked information level of mobilephone use and there were several potential sources of misclassification of exposure  the bulk of evidence came from reports of the interphone study  a very large international  multicentre casecontrol study and a separate large casecontrol study from sweden gliomas and meningiomas of the brain and acoustic neuromas  while affected by selection bias and information bias to varying degrees  these studies showed an association between glioma and acoustic neuroma and mobilephone use  specifically in people with highest cumulative use of mobile phones  in people who had used mobile phones the same side of the head that which their tumour developed  and in people whose tumour was in the temporal lobe of the brain  the area of the brain that is most exposed to rf radiation when a wireless phone is used at the ear     ref nameiarccancer    cite book url https

radiation    rfr  like that used in 2g and 3g cell phones developed cancerous heart tumors  there was also some evidence of tumors in the brain and adrenal gland of exposed male rats  for female rats
