Larger venues tend to attract bigger crowds, likely due to more prominent teams and leagues, increased marketing efforts, and higher anticipation for competitive games.  However, as seen with the Carolina Mudcats, there can be exceptions to this correlation, which could be attributed to a variety of factors including team performance, fan interest, and sport popularity in that particular area.  In conclusion, while venue capacity can be an indicator of average attendance at sporting events in Raleigh, it is not an absolute determinant. There may be other factors at play, and individual teams and venues may not always adhere to the general trend.",
