Then it go down a little, but keep going up until it reached 96.6% in 2008. But in 2007 there is a big drop in the success, only 81.6% of the dominoes fall down. This was not good, but in 2008 the success rate come back to 96.6%, and the last event in 2009 also good with 93.6% success rate. So, the not good result in 2007 doesn't make the success rate bad in the years after that, as the next events still have high percentages of dominoes falling down.",
