The first position was secured by Fernando Alonso from Spain, driving for Renault, with a Q2 time of 1:37.044. The difference in their times, or the gap, can be calculated by subtracting Alonso's time from Firman's time. Thus, the gap between Ralph Firman and Fernando Alonso during the qualifying round was 1:40.910 - 1:37.044 = 3.866 seconds.",

In the earlier years, notably from 1920 to 1956, the flag bearers predominantly came from the sports of Fencing, Sailing, and Athletics. However, more recently, the flag bearers' sports representation has diversified to include snowboarding, bobsleigh, table tennis, judo, and short track speed skating, among others. This trend shows an increased recognition and presence of various sports at the Olympics, reflecting Belgium's broader participation and achievements across different athletic disciplines.",
