There is a notable increase in the average height of these buildings, with the Vero Centre, the tallest in Auckland, standing at 574 feet, while the earlier buildings from the 1960s and 1970s were significantly shorter like the Civic Building at 233 feet. The number of floors also has an upward trend, with newer buildings having more floors on average compared to older ones, evident from the fact that Vero Centre has 38 while West Plaza Building from 1974 has only 18 floors.

On the other hand, Chattagahaka Jantu, who ruled from 434 to 435, gained his position through marriage to Sangha, the daughter of Mahanama by his Sinhala Queen. Mahanama was Chattagahaka Jantu's predecessor, making Sangha a key link between the two rulers. As a result, both Mittasena and Chattagahaka Jantu came to rule through their respective relationships with their predecessors, one through marriage and the other through force.",
