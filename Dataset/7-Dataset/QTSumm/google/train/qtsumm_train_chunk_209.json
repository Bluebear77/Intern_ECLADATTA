The faster the swimmer's time, the higher their ranking in the event. For instance, Lisbeth Trickett from Australia had the fastest time of 56.73 seconds, earning her the first-place ranking and an Olympic record. As the times increase from Trickett's time, the ranking decreases, demonstrating a correlation between a swimmer's time and their final rank in the event.",

In the early years, the race speed ranged from 41.455 km/hour in 1936 when Gustave Danneels from Belgium held the title, to 42.092 km/hour in 1938 when Jules Rossi from Italy claimed the record. After a slight slowdown period, the speed saw a significant increase from 43.612 km/hour in 1948 to 46.110 km/hour in 1975. The largest growth, however, occurred between 1975 and 2015, as the speeds surged from 46.110 km/hour recorded by Freddy Maertens from Belgium to a record-breaking 49.641 km/hour achieved by Matteo Trentin from Italy in 2015. Overall, the Ruban Jaune race has witnessed considerable progression in speed over an approximate 80-year period, demonstrating the steady improvement of athletic performance and technological advancements in cycling.",
