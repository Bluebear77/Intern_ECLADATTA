        "summary": "The stadium expansion significantly impacts the ranking of the English football - Premier League Stadiums as it changes the order of some clubs based on their increased capacity. Notably, the Etihad Stadium, White Hart Lane, Stamford Bridge, and Goodison Park see major improvements in their rank with expanded capacities of 63,000, 62,062, 60,000, and 60,000 respectively, placing them in the top 6 positions. Additionally, the King Power Stadium advances in the ranking, going from the 12th to the 10th position with an expanded capacity of 42,000. Overall, these expansions result in higher capacity stadiums for the clubs, which directly translates to potential growth in audience and revenue.",
