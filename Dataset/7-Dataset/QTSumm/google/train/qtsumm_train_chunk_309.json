        "summary": "The position of defender (DF) players like David Jeffrey and Noel Bailie significantly affects their goals/games ratio compared to a forward (FW) player such as Glenn Ferguson. As defenders, Jeffrey and Bailie primarily focus on preventing the opposing team from scoring goals, and thus, their opportunities to score goals are fewer compared to forwards. In contrast, forwards like Glenn Ferguson are primarily responsible for scoring goals and have more opportunities to do so during a game. Consequently, the goals/games ratio for defenders like Jeffrey (0.26) and Bailie (0.02) is considerably lower than that of a forward like Ferguson (0.55).",
