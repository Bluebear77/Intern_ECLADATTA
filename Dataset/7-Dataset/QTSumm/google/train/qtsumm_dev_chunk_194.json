This shows a big increase in construction and development activity in that year compare to other years listed. From this information, we can guess that 2017 sees fast urban development in Mississauga, maybe because of the need for housing or big investments in the area. However, we need to think that this table only shows the tallest buildings, and looking at all the construction projects can give a more clear image of the construction and urban development in Mississauga at that time.",
