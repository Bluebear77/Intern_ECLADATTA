This is because the 10th team had a higher number of points, 8 points compared to 3 points for the 15th team, indicating that they had more wins. Additionally, the 10th team had a difference of 28-10, showing that they scored much more goals than they conceded. On the other hand, while the 15th team also had 3 points, their difference was 19-41 which suggests that they lost a lot of goals in comparison to their opponents. Therefore, based on these factors, it can be concluded that the 10th team was more likely to win if they were to compete against the 15th team.",
