The premieres of the concertos took place between March 1735 and February 1736, evidencing that the concertos were performed soon after their completion. However, the publication of the works did not happen until 1738, two to three years after their composition and initial performances. Though the timelines show that publication came later than the performances, it is important to note that all the concertos within Op. 4 were published in the same year, indicating a deliberate and cohesive release of the series.",
