As years go, better engineering and construction technology let us build more tall buildings, resulting in new buildings usually more tall than old ones. We can see this in Devon Energy Center, finished in 2012, is now tallest building in Oklahoma. In other side, old buildings like First National Center, finished in 1931, was once tallest in state, but moved down in rank as new and taller buildings were built. This pattern makes us think taller buildings will keep being built as time go on, and make change in height rank for buildings in Oklahoma.",
