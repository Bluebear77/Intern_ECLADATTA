In the 1950 election, as a Conservative candidate, he received 22,872 votes with a 46.9% voting percentage. Upon switching to the National Front, there was a noticeable decrease in his voting percentages. In the 1968 election, Fountaine secured only 1,400 votes, which accounted for 5.6% of the total votes, and in 1979, his voting percentage dropped further to 0.7%, with just 264 votes. Thus, the change in party affiliation from Conservative to National Front negatively impacted Andrew Fountaine's voting success.",
