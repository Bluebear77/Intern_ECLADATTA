In 2000, they held a majority of 64.09% of the popular vote, but this drastically dropped to 12.58% in 2003. Their voting share continued to decline in subsequent elections, reaching as low as 0.94% in 2016. Possible factors influencing these changes could include changing political alliances, as their coalition partners varied in each election, and shifting voter preferences in response to new parties or circumstances within the Serbian political landscape. Additionally, the party's movement between government and opposition roles could have contributed to the loss of voter trust and support over time.",
