On the other hand, the Rym from Norway had the least casualties, with zero lives lost. When comparing these figures with the ship's tonnage, it is observed that the W.C Teagle had a tonnage of 9,552, which is much higher than Rym's tonnage of 1,369. This suggests that larger ships were more likely to have a higher number of casualties. Additionally, both ships with the highest and least casualties belonged to different nationalities, indicating that nationality might not be directly related to the number of casualties.",
