        "summary": "The founding years of the institutions in the Sunshine State Conference span over a century, with the oldest being Florida Southern College, founded in 1883, and the newest being Palm Beach Atlantic University, founded in 1968. The majority of the institutions were founded in the 20th century, indicating a period of growth and development for higher education in Florida. Regarding nicknames, a mix of marine-related and land-based creatures can be observed: Tritons, Buccaneers, Sailfish, Sharks, Eagles, Moccasins, Panthers, Fighting Knights, Tars, Lions, and Spartans. These nicknames seem to reflect each institution's unique identity, with some institutions opting for marine-related nicknames perhaps due to their coastal locations, while others chose nicknames originating from land-based creatures or historical figures.",
