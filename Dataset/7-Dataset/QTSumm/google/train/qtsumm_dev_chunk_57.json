        "summary": "In 1957 Big Ten Conference football season, seem to have general relate between teams' Associated Press (AP) rank and Points Against (PAG) data. Top teams in this conference with more high AP rank, like Ohio State, Michigan State, and Iowa, have less PAG value, show strong defense play. On other side, teams with low or no AP rank like Indiana and Northwestern have more high PAG value, mean their defense let more point on average through season. So, can guess that low PAG value is one important factor for have more high AP rank of teams in 1957 Big Ten Conference football season.",

        "summary": "From table, we can see there is relation between number seats party fight and number seats they win. Indian National Congress fight more seats (221) and get more win (178) with high percent vote (43.76%). Janata Dal also fight 209 seats and get 24 seats, make them second best party in election. But this relation not always straight, like Janata Party fight 217 seats but only win 2 seats. This show other things like party popular and vote percent also important for how many seats a party win.",
