Teams with higher PPG numbers usually did better in their whole record and conference record, making higher standing in whole conference ranking. For example, two top-ranked teams, Illinois and Michigan, both get highest PPG numbers of 18.8 and 17.0, which help their very good whole and conference records. On other side, teams with lower PPG numbers like Indiana and Northwestern had not so good whole records, and so they stand lower in conference ranking.",
