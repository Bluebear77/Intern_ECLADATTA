Sweden only has one athlete represented in this list, Edvin Wide, and he only won 1 silver and 1 bronze total. By comparison, Finland has 4 different athletes represented, all of whom won at least two medals each. This suggests that the athletes from Finland are more competitive than those from Sweden. Additionally, Ethiopia appears to have 3 competitive athletes who won a total of 6 medals between them. This indicates that Ethiopia is likely a more competitive nation when it comes to athletics than Sweden.",
