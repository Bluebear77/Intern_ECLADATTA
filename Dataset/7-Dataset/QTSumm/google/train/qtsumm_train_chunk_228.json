        "summary": "The total scores in figure skating have consistently improved over the years, as evidenced by the higher scores achieved by junior athletes at various World Junior Championships. In 2012, Yulia Lipnitskaya from Russia set a high score of 187.05, but this was soon surpassed by Elena Radionova's 194.29, another Russian skater, at the 2014 World Junior Championships. A significant improvement was observed in 2017 when Alina Zagitova from Russia scored an impressive 208.60, and this record was further shattered in 2018 with Alexandra Trusova's outstanding 225.52, once again representing Russia. The upward trend in scores shows that the level of competition and skill in junior figure skaters continues to rise, with the World Junior Championships being a prime example of this growth.",
