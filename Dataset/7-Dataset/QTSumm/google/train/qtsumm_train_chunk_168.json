Looking at publication years in table, it is clear that most releases happened in years 2010, with five stories published. Years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2012 also have multiple releases, with two to three stories coming out each year. However, there were years like 2006, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017 where only one story was published, suggest an inconsistence in timeline of publication for these short fiction stories.",
