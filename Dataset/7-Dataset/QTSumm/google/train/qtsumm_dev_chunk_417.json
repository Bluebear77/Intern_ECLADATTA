For example, Lake Toba, which is volcanic/tectonic lake, has largest area of all lakes in the list at 1,130 km\u00b2 and an impressive maximum depth of 529 meters. Similarly, Lake Maninjau, a caldera lake, has relatively large area of 97.9 km\u00b2 and significant maximum depth of 169 meters. On other hand, tectonic lakes like Lake Laut Tawar, Lake Diatas, and Lake Dibawah generally have smaller area size and maximum depth compare to volcanic or caldera lakes. This correlations show that volcanic and caldera lakes often have big surface area and large depths, while tectonic lakes usually have smaller size in both aspects.",
