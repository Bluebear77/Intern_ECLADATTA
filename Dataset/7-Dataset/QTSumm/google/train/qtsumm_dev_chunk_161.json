Clubs from Spain and England tend to shell out significantly more for Rosenborg BK players, with Valencia and Liverpool taking the top spots in terms of transfer fees. In contrast, clubs from other countries, such as the Netherlands, Scotland, and Germany, generally pay lower amounts for the same type of players. While not an absolute trend, it can be said that the financial capacity and market size of clubs in different countries could be a contributing factor to the transfer fees paid for Rosenborg BK players.",
