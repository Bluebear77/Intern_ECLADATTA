        "summary": "Based on the information provided in the table, there appears to be a correlation between the speed of the riders and their rank in the 1934 Isle of Man TT - Senior TT (500cc) competition. Generally, higher speeds are associated with superior ranks, as evidenced by Jimmie Guthrie, who finished first with the highest speed of 78.01, and A. J. Mitchell, who finished tenth with a speed of 68.68. However, there are some exceptions to this trend, such as Les Archer, who had the highest speed of 80.54 but finished fourth. This inconsistency might be attributed to other factors, such as rider experience, motorcycle performance, or individual strategies during the race. Despite these anomalies, a faster speed generally correlates with a higher-ranking position in the competition.",

On the other side, Liberal group looks like more oppose same-sex marriage, as 13 members vote for it and 85 members against it. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and NDP groups seem to have same thinking against same-sex marriage, because no one of their members vote for this issue, and 47 and 29 members respectively against it. It is interesting, Independent group has two different opinion, one member against it, and another member not there.
