        "summary": "In 1971 Big Ten Conference football time, Illinois football team have mix performance under Head Coach Bob Blackman. They get third place in conference, same with Ohio State and Michigan State. All record is 5-6, and conference record 5-3, this mean they play better with Big Ten teams than other teams. For Point Per Game (PPG), Illinois get only 14.8, much less than Michigan (they get 35.1 PPG).   This make we think maybe Illinois offense not very good as other teams in conference. But also, Illinois have Points Against per Game (PAG) 21.6 that is in middle of the teams in the conference. This show maybe their defense is good, and maybe this is why they can tie for third place in conference.",
