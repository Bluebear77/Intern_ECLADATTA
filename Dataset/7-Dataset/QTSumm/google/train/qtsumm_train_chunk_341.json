There are cases where higher-rated games, like Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart: Super Circuit, have lower sales numbers compare to others games in series with lower scores. But, some games like Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, have both high scores and high sales numbers. This suggests that even though good reviews may play role in sales of game, it is not the only deciding factor, and there maybe other variables, such as time, console popularity, and marketing that also contribute to the total sales results.",

The height of the tallest buildings has consistently increased, starting from the Dyal-Upchurch Building at 82 ft / 25 m in 1902 to the current Bank of America Tower at 617 ft / 188 m, built in 1990. In addition, the number of floors in these buildings has also seen a steady growth, with the Dyal-Upchurch Building having only 6 floors, while the Bank of America Tower has 42 floors. Furthermore, the chronology of the city's tallest buildings reflects Jacksonville's development and its ambition to create modern buildings and infrastructure within the urban landscape.",
