The ship was built in Seattle, Washington by Moran Bros., a well-known shipbuilder of that time. The builder assigned the hull number 9 to the J. P. Light, an important detail for any vessel. In terms of specifications, this particular vessel had a volume of 785 gross tons, making it a considerably sized ship for its era. The hull of the J. P. Light measured 176 feet in length, which was typical for a Moran sternwheeler. Over the course of its lifetime, the ownership of the J. P. Light changed hands, eventually being sold to the Dawson White Horse Navigation Co..",

        "summary": "From table, we can see most NCAA Division I men basketball career blocks leaders play more than 100 games in their career. Also, the players who have high number of blocks, such as Jarvis Varnado and Wojciech Myrda, they play more games too, like 141 and 115 games. But, not exact link between how many games play and how many blocks, because some players play less games but have many blocks, like Adonal Foyle, he got 492 blocks in only 87 games. Other way, some players play more games, like Shelden Williams with 139 games, but blocks not too high, only 422. So, it look like more games play can make more blocks, but player own skill and ability still very important for how many blocks they can get.",
