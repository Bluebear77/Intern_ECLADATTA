        "summary": "From the provided table of earthquake incidences in 2004, it can be inferred that there is a correlation between the death toll and the magnitude of the earthquakes. The deadliest earthquake, which occurred in Indonesia on 26th December, had the highest magnitude of 9.1-9.3 and caused an astounding 227,898 fatalities. However, it is important to note that earthquake magnitude alone does not entirely determine the number of casualties, as seen by lower-magnitude quakes in Morocco and Japan with higher death tolls than other comparatively higher-magnitude quakes in Indonesia. Factors such as the intensity (MMI), depth, and the population density in the affected region also play a significant role in the impact of an earthquake on human lives.",
