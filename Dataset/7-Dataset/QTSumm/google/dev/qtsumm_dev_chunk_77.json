In the shortest race of 7 furlongs at Berlin-Hoppegarten, Kazzia secured a first-place finish with a margin of 1.25 lengths. On the other hand, the longest race she participated in was the 12 furlong race at Epsom, where she also managed to finish in first place but with a slimmer margin of victory, only half a length ahead of the second-place horse.

When bucket capacity get bigger, operating weight of power shovel also get bigger, this show a strong positive connection between these two things. But, there are some special cases like Marion 5960-M (Big Digger) and Bucyrus-Erie 1950-B (The Silver Spade); both has different bucket capacity but, very surprising, have almost same operating weight. Even if there are these little not same, we can say that bucket capacity and operating weight of power shovels mostly depend on each other.",
