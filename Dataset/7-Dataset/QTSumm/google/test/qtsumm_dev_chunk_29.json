        "summary": "In the 1967 Eurovision Song Contest, a majority of countries chose to perform in their native or non-English languages, with only two countries opting for English. There appears to be little correlation between language choice and ranking or points in this particular contest. The United Kingdom, performing in English, won the contest with 47 points, while Ireland, also performing in English, came in second place with 22 points. However, many non-English language performances also ranked quite high, such as France in third place with 20 points and Luxembourg in fourth place with 17 points. Overall, the decision to perform in a native or non-English language versus English did not significantly affect the rankings or points earned by the countries in this Eurovision Song Contest.",
