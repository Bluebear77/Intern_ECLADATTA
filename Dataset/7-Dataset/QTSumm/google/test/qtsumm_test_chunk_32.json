Riders ranging from 24 to 33 years have achieved impressive distances, with a majority of the riders in their late 20s and early 30s. In fact, Tony Rominger set two records at the age of 33, riding the farthest distance of 55.291 km. Overall, the variation in distances achieved appears to be more influenced by equipment advancements and individual skill than the age of the riders.",
