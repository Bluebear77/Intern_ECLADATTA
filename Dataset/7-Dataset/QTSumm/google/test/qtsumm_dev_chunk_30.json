For example, the Superb 4000 model has the highest engine capacity (4.0 L V8 OHV), horse-power (96) and the highest fuel use (24 L/100km). But, the Superb OHV and Superb 3000 models have almost the same engine capacity and horse-power, still the Superb 3000 model is a little less fuel efficient (18 L/100km) compared to the Superb OHV model (18 L/100km), which might be due to other factors like vehicle weight or air flow.",
