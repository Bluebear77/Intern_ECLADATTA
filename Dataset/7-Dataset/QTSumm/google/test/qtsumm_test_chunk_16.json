Top four rank teams - Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio State, and Purdue - all have small PAG scores compare to teams with not so good rankings. This make think strong defense, not let many points scored against them, help them do good during the season. On the other hand, teams with big PAG scores, like Michigan and Minnesota, have low rankings in the meeting.
