Throughout this period, technology and equipment have also evolved, transitioning from bullhorn handlebars, oval steel tubing frames, and disc wheels to Graeme Obree \"superman-style\" handlebars, carbon monocoque aero frames, and 5-spoke front and rear disc wheels. This trend evidently demonstrates the significant impact of advancements in equipment, as well as the athletic endeavor of these record-breaking cyclists, allowing riders to cover greater distances with increased efficiency in less time.",
