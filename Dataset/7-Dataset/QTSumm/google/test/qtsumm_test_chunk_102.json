Generally, there seems to be a trend of taller buildings being built in the late 20th century, with the top four tallest buildings in the city being constructed between 1914 and 1995. However, this trend is not consistent, as evidenced by Saint Michael's Church, which was constructed in 1890 and holds the 10th position in height. Overall, while there appears to be some correlation between the age of some buildings and their height, there are notable exceptions, and no clear, direct relationship can be established between the two factors.",
