For instance, the Faith Dome in Crenshaw had a capacity of 10,145 and was completed in 1989. In contrast, the Glory Dome, the largest church auditorium in Nigeria, was completed in 2018 and has a capacity of 100,000. Although there are some exceptions to this trend - such as the Yoido Full Gospel Church completed in 1973 with a capacity of 12,000 - the general pattern indicates that larger church auditoriums have been built more recently. This correlation between the year of completion and increasing capacity suggests that churches have expanded their reach and congregation size over the years, simultaneously working to accommodate larger gatherings within their auditoriums.",
