## Metrics
- **Precision**: 0.86
- **Recall**: 0.92

## Explanation
The data provided consists of various articles with their respective titles and matched titles. Based on the Boolean column indicating True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN), the precision and recall metrics have been calculated to an accuracy of two decimal points. The confusion matrix visualizes the actual versus predicted conditions, showcasing the performance of the classification.

- **Precision** is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall** is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.

Both metrics indicate a balanced performance of the classification model.
