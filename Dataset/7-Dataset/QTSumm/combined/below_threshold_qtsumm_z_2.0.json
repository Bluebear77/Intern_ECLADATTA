However, Weidler's performance took a hit in 1990, with only 148 laps completed and not finishing the race.

This stadium is closely followed by Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, which can hold 82,300 spectators. Football stadiums in Florida with mid-level capacities include Camping World Stadium in Orlando (70,000), TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville (67,246), Raymond James Stadium in Tampa (65,857), and Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens (65,326). The smaller stadiums such as Spectrum Stadium (45,301) in Orlando and FAU Stadium (30,000) in Boca Raton highlight the diverse range of football stadium sizes within the state. Comparing these capacities confirms that Ben Hill Griffin Stadium is the largest sports stadium in Florida.",

Seven out of the top ten scorers were from Uzbekistan, which clearly showcases their strong performance in the competitions. In total, Uzbek players scored 45 goals from the top seven players in this category. However, it's worth noting that the top scorer, with 14 goals, was Montenegro's Ivan Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, demonstrating that although Uzbek players performed well collectively, the highest individual achievement came from a player outside the region.",

He not only is leader of Moldavia from 1600 to 1600, but also ruled Wallachia from 1593 to 1600 and Transylvania from 1599 to 1600. He also called Michael the Brave, because of his good reputation and things he did during rule time. Radu Mihnea, another leader from Dr\u0103cule\u0219ti line, ruled Moldavia from 1616 to 1619, which was his first time of ruling. Table not have more notes about Radu Mihnea, so maybe his rule not as important as Michael the Brave.",

Another pattern is that as the league progressed, there were more teams founded in the later years, indicating a growth in interest and participation in the K3 League. Lastly, some of the earlier-founded teams, like Cheongju City FC and Cheongju FC, took longer to join the K3 League, which could be due to the league's establishment and consolidation in its initial years.",

Mittasena, who ruled from 435 to 436, was noted as a plunderer, likely indicating that he gained power through aggressive actions and military conquests. On the other hand, Chattagahaka Jantu, who ruled from 434 to 435, gained his position through marriage to Sangha, the daughter of Mahanama by his Sinhala Queen. Mahanama was Chattagahaka Jantu's predecessor, making Sangha a key link between the two rulers. As a result, both Mittasena and Chattagahaka Jantu came to rule through their respective relationships with their predecessors, one through marriage and the other through force.",

        "summary": "The line of succession among the House of Lambakanna I predominantly followed a patrilineal pattern, whereby the throne was passed down from father to son or to younger brothers. This pattern can be observed through the reigns of Vasabha, Vankanasika Tissa, Gajabahu I, Mahallaka Naga, Bhatika Tissa, and Kanittha Tissa. Additionally, some kings like Upatissa I and Mahanama gained the throne as a result of being the brothers or sons of their predecessors. However, exceptions to this pattern occurred in instances like Gothabhaya, who became king through his role as a Minister of State, and Chattagahaka Jantu, who gained the throne through marriage to Sangha, the daughter of Mahanama by his Sinhala Queen.",
