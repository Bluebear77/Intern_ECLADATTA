This stadium is closely followed by Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, which can hold 82,300 spectators. Football stadiums in Florida with mid-level capacities include Camping World Stadium in Orlando (70,000), TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville (67,246), Raymond James Stadium in Tampa (65,857), and Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens (65,326). The smaller stadiums such as Spectrum Stadium (45,301) in Orlando and FAU Stadium (30,000) in Boca Raton highlight the diverse range of football stadium sizes within the state. Comparing these capacities confirms that Ben Hill Griffin Stadium is the largest sports stadium in Florida.",

The initial decrease in time from 43.06 seconds in 1983 to 41.58 seconds in 1987 shows a significant improvement in just four years. This trend of improvement continues over the years, with a notable tie between Russia and the United States in 1993, both achieving a time of 41.49 seconds. Most recently, in 2015, the Jamaican team established  a record time of 41.07 seconds.",

        "summary": "The South China Mall opened in 2005, making it one of the earlier malls on the list of largest shopping malls with a gross leasable area of over 500,000 m2. However, its current status does not reflect great success, as until at least 2014, most of the stores in the mall were empty and occupancy rates were as low as 10%. This indicates that despite being among the largest malls, South China Mall struggled in its initial years to attract retailers and customers, dampening its overall success.",

On the other hand, best performance of American player was Jeff Sluman, who finished at 25th place and tied with +3 score.

This big going up can be because for first time, there was a writing score (509), because now test had three parts not two. So, total score also showed this change by putting together math and critical reading scores (1,021) but not with writing score. This change in how scores work can give better look at how students do by looking at their writing also, not just math and critical reading.",

First, the majority of teams joined the K3 League within a year or two of their founding. This suggests that many of these teams were established with the intention of participating in the K3 League. Another pattern is that as the league progressed, there were more teams founded in the later years, indicating a growth in interest and participation in the K3 League. Lastly, some of the earlier-founded teams, like Cheongju City FC and Cheongju FC, took longer to join the K3 League, which could be due to the league's establishment and consolidation in its initial years.",

However, there are also cases where newer buildings hold lower ranks, such as Park Residences (2017) at rank 12 and Victoria Residences (2018) at rank 25, indicating that age is not the sole determinant of a building's rank in terms of height.",

        "summary": "In analyzing the construction trends of Auckland's tallest buildings, it appears that a majority of these structures were built between the years 1980 and 2009, showcasing the city's focus on urban development during this time period. There is a notable increase in the average height of these buildings, with the Vero Centre, the tallest in Auckland, standing at 574 feet, while the earlier buildings from the 1960s and 1970s were significantly shorter like the Civic Building at 233 feet. The number of floors also has an upward trend, with newer buildings having more floors on average compared to older ones, evident from the fact that Vero Centre has 38 while West Plaza Building from 1974 has only 18 floors.

On the other hand, Chattagahaka Jantu, who ruled from 434 to 435, gained his position through marriage to Sangha, the daughter of Mahanama by his Sinhala Queen. Mahanama was Chattagahaka Jantu's predecessor, making Sangha a key link between the two rulers. As a result, both Mittasena and Chattagahaka Jantu came to rule through their respective relationships with their predecessors, one through marriage and the other through force.",

This pattern can be observed through the reigns of Vasabha, Vankanasika Tissa, Gajabahu I, Mahallaka Naga, Bhatika Tissa, and Kanittha Tissa. Additionally, some kings like Upatissa I and Mahanama gained the throne as a result of being the brothers or sons of their predecessors. However, exceptions to this pattern occurred in instances like Gothabhaya, who became king through his role as a Minister of State, and Chattagahaka Jantu, who gained the throne through marriage to Sangha, the daughter of Mahanama by his Sinhala Queen.",

Examples of these distinctive theme song performers include a Frozen OJ container with money, convenience store snacks, and hotel card-key from episodes 1, 2, and 3 respectively. As the season progressed, other unusual theme song performers featured were body charms, initials carved in a tree, restaurant place mats, packets of butter, Pioneer City welcome sign, child's crayon drawing, Sky Mall catalog, passport stamp, cadaver toe-tag, and gate at airport.",
