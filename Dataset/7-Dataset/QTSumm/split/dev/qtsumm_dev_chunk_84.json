Generally, higher capacity venues maybe have more cost, but there have exceptions. For example, Lillehammer Olympic Alpine Centre Kvitfjell have capacity of 41,000 and cost 122 MNOK, but Lysg\u00e5rdsbakkene Ski Jumping Arena have capacity of 35,000 and cost more, 135 MNOK. On the other hand, Gj\u00f8vik Olympic Cavern Hall with only 5,300 capacity have high cost 92 MNOK. So, there is general idea that higher capacity venues have more cost, but some cases not like this, maybe because factors like differences in building need and place specific things.",
