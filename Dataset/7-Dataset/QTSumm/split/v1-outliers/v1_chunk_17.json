In his meeting with Zimbabwe, he got 7/116 and 5/95 in his 3rd and 19th career matches, respectively. Both of these games was happening at Harare Sports Club in Zimbabwe, showing his good performance in the same place.  On other side, his only one performance with Pakistan, in his 21st match, saw him got 5/103 at the National Stadium in Karachi. Compare the numbers, it is clear that Pushpakumara's performance is little better against Zimbabwe, especially in his 3rd match, where he got a great 7-wicket haul. In general, his performance was very good against both countries, but little more success against Zimbabwe can be seen.",
