First, the majority of teams joined the K3 League within a year or two of their founding. This suggests that many of these teams were established with the intention of participating in the K3 League. Another pattern is that as the league progressed, there were more teams founded in the later years, indicating a growth in interest and participation in the K3 League. Lastly, some of the earlier-founded teams, like Cheongju City FC and Cheongju FC, took longer to join the K3 League, which could be due to the league's establishment and consolidation in its initial years.",
