        "summary": "The winning prize money for the Russet Stakes experienced fluctuations over the 15-year period from 1895 to 1909. It initially witnessed an upward trend from the $1,150 prize awarded in 1895 to Bathampton, gradually increasing to $3,550 in 1905 for Jacquin, the highest winning amount in this time frame. However, the prize money dipped to its lowest in 1898, with Thomas Cat receiving just $680. Following 1905, there was a slight decline in the winning prize amount, with the lowest post-1905 figure being $1,050 for both Bonnie Kelso in 1909 and Bedouin in 1908. Overall, the Russet Stakes winning prize experienced both growth and decline during these years, with 1905 displaying the highest winnings and 1898 showing the lowest.",
