In total, Uzbek players scored 45 goals from the top seven players in this category. However, it's worth noting that the top scorer, with 14 goals, was Montenegro's Ivan Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, demonstrating that although Uzbek players performed well collectively, the highest individual achievement came from a player outside the region.",
