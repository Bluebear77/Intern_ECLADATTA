Additionally, certain countries appear to consistently produce high-performing competitors. England is well-represented in the list, with Graham Hicks setting the English Record twice and Eddie Hall also setting an English Record, suggesting that the country has a strong presence in the sport. Furthermore, the presence of both Cheick \"Iron Biby\" Sanou and \u017dydr\u016bnas Savickas multiple times on the list for Burkina Faso and Lithuania, respectively, demonstrates that these countries also have athletes who consistently achieve the heaviest lifts at the World Log Lift Championships.",
