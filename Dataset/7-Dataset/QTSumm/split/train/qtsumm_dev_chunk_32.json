Having the same number of points, their positions in the final ranking were very close but different. Latvia secured the 13th place, while Macedonia took the 12th position.  Russia secured the 4th place, while Belarus took the 3rd position. This difference in placement with the same scores indicates that there was a tiebreaker rule or mechanism in place to determine the ranking of countries when they have identical points. As a result, the final standings were affected, and Latvia ranked lower than Macedonia in the competition.",

First, it looks like he get more points as his career goes on, with most points (747) in 2011 Fujitsu V8 Supercar Series. But this not mean he gets better positions, because he is 12th place in 2006 and 2011. Number of races in each season is different, but if there are more races, Cregan maybe can get more points.
