The first ruler, Asad al-Dawla 'Atiyya, was son of Asad al-Dawla Salih, and his brother Mu'izz al-Dawla Thimal succeed him in 1061. 'Atiyya return to power in 1062, marking his second reign as Emir of Halab. In 1065, different family branch took over, with Rashid al-Dawla Mahmud (Mahmud I), son of Shibl al-Dawla Nasr, ruling until 1075. After Mahmud I, his son Jalal al-Dawla Nasr (Nasr II) took throne in 1075, followed by another son, Sabiq ibn Mahmud (Sabiq), in 1076. This pattern shows importance of lineage and kinship in securing power and continue rule of Mirdasid dynasty in Aleppo.",
