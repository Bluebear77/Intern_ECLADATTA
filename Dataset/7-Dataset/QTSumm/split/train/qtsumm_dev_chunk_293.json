These two weightlifters secured a total of 332 kg, making India a significant performer in this specific event. Australia also had two representatives, namely Vivian Lee and Erika Yamasaki. However, Erika Yamasaki could not complete her performance due to a \"Did Not Finish\" (DNF) result, which adversely impacted Australia's overall standing in this competition. Vivian Lee managed to rank 5th, securing 160 kg.
