In 1984 Big Ten Conference football season, Ohio State, which score highest PPG at 32.6, achieve best AP final rank of #13. Iowa, rank #16 in final AP ranking, score second-highest PPG at 27.6. However, there are exception to this pattern, like Illinois, which score 29.4 PPG but not receive final AP rank. Also, Michigan, which score lower PPG of 17.8, still rank higher at some point in season with AP high of #3.
