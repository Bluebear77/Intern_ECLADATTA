        "summary": "The televote in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 for Lithuania's final appears to have a strong correlation with the placement of the songs. As seen in the table, higher televote numbers generally result in better placement, with Jeronimas Milius' \"Nomads in the Night\" receiving the highest televote at 11,674 and securing the first place. Similarly, Aist\u0117 Pilvelyt\u0117's \"Troy on Fire\" received the second-highest televote of 11,242, placing her second in the competition. This pattern continues with Sasha Son's \"Miss Kiss\" receiving 8,306 televotes landing in third place, and Raimonda Masiulyt\u0117's \"Birdie's Tweet\" getting 7,391 televotes and finishing fourth. Overall, the televote appears to have a mostly linear relationship with the placement of the songs in Lithuania's Eurovision Song Contest 2008.",
