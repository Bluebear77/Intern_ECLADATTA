Mostly, in seasons with better win-loss record, the points team get are more, and the points lose are less. For example, in 1964, they getting first place with 9-1 win-loss record, they get 235 points and lose only 83 points. Other side, in 1962 they in 10th place with 2-7 win-loss record, they get only 70 points and lose 214 points.
