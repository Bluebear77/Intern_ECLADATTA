Many ministers from Liberal Party (LP) and Catholic Party (PC) have office, but LP often have short time, some ministers only one year or less. However, PC have ministers with more time in office, like Felix de Muelenaere, who have three different times, and Guillaume d'Aspremont Lynden, who have seven years. In total, even if LP and PC have Foreign Ministers with different office times, we can see PC normally have longer time than LP.",
