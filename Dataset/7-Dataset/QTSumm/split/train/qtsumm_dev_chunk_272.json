        "summary": "From 1932 to 2018, the representation of Winter and Summer sports among French flag bearers at the Olympics has shown a diverse range of athletes and sports. In the early years, athletics (track and field) and figure skating were predominant sports for flag bearers, such as Georges Torchon in 1932 and Jules No\u00ebl in 1936. However, with the passing of time, the representation expanded to include a wider variety of sports such as biathlon, alpine skiing, and nordic combined for Winter Olympics and judo, fencing, and handball for Summer Olympics. This evolution in flag bearer representation highlights France's growing prowess in various sports disciplines and showcases the country's commitment to nurturing talent in different areas, not just traditionally popular ones.",
