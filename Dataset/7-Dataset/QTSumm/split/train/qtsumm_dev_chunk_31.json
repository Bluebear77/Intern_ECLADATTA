In the early years from 1993 to 1996, he had a fairly balanced mix of successes and runner-up finishes, with his first win in 1993 at the Grand Prix and three runner-up finishes in subsequent years. From 1997 to 2009, Ebdon experienced a more prominent winning streak, with six titles, including key championships like the World Snooker Championship in 2002, UK Championship in 2006, and two China Open wins in 2009 and 2012. Despite having nine runner-up finishes in total, the majority of these took place in the earlier years of his career, with only three instances after 2001, indicating a more stable performance and greater success in the latter part of his career.",
