In the Miss World pageant, the controversy began in 1951 when Kiki H\u00e5kansson from Sweden was crowned the winner while wearing a bikini, leading to countries with strong religious traditions threatening to withdraw their delegates. This resulted in the pageant toning down its swimsuits to more modest designs in the years that followed. Similarly, in the 2003 Miss Earth competition, the participation of Vida Samadzai from Afghanistan while wearing a bikini caused an uproar in her native country due to cultural and religious concerns. Both instances highlight how the inclusion of bikinis in international pageants can lead to cultural clashes and controversies.",
