<p>This is a <b>list of experiments from the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney" title="Disney" class="mw-redirect">Disney</a> animated <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch" title="Lilo &amp; Stitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a></i> franchise</b>, a series of fictional characters, most of which make their first appearances in <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch:_The_Series" title="Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series">Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series</a></i>. These experiments are <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetically engineered</a> creatures created by Dr. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumba_Jookiba" title="Jumba Jookiba" class="mw-redirect">Jumba Jookiba</a> in his lab at "Galaxy Defense Industries", with the assistance of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Jacques_von_H%C3%A4msterviel" title="Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel" class="mw-redirect">Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel</a> who funded the projects with "shady" business deals. Prior to the events of <i>Lilo &amp; Stitch</i>, every experiment created was dehydrated into a small orb called an "experiment pod" and stored in a special container for transport. In <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stitch!_The_Movie" title="Stitch! The Movie">Stitch! The Movie</a></i>, the container was accidentally opened and the pods rained down on the island of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauai" title="Kauai">Kaua<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i</a>. The experiments within the pods are reactivated upon contact with water, a point of concern because many of the experiments are dangerous and Kaua<span class="unicode">ʻ</span>i hosts one of the wettest spots on Earth.</p>
<p>Upon encountering each experiment, Stitch's human friend and partner <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_Pelekai" title="Lilo Pelekai" class="mw-redirect">Lilo</a> gives the experiment a name just as she gave Stitch his name. The two then attempt to rehabilitate the experiments and find a purpose for them on Earth that suits their specific abilities, referred to as the "one true place" they belong.</p>
<p>Stitch, inspired by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaiian</a> terminology, refers to the other experiments as his "cousins" and considers them all a part of his <i><span class="unicode">ʻ</span><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohana" title="Ohana">ohana</a></i>, or "extended family". All of Jumba's original 626 experiments have their names and numbers listed alongside the credits in <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch" title="Lilo &amp; Stitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a></i>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Experiment_Biology">Experiment Biology</span></h2>
<p>Due to different experiments' original purposes, most experiments each have a unique appearance, powers and weaknesses. Though all experiments have unique capabilities and functions, most of them have some abilities in common. For one thing, most seem capable of scaling walls like a gecko (as Stitch frequently does); many are able to grow and retract an extra pair of arms and they all seem to be immune to aging, as the experiments remain the same while Lilo and the rest of humanity age 20 years in "Skip".</p>
<p>It is also shown that some experiments' powers (such as Mr. Stenchy (254)'s cuteness, and Checkers (029)'s hypnotic effect) do not affect other experiments, possibly so that these powers do not prevent other experiments from carrying out their primary functions.</p>
<p>It is also shown that when an experiment is dehydrated, they will deactivate and turn into a small orb called an experiment pod. If an experiment pod gets wet, the experiment will be reactivated and released. According to Jumba, a home food dehydrator is the only known method of deactivating an experiment a second time.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Creation">Creation</span></h3>
<p>Upon each experiment's creation, their molecules must be charged. If an experiment's molecules are not fully charged, about a year after their creation, they will suffer glitches, during which they will experience seizures and temporarily revert to their original programming. If the molecular charging process is not completed, these glitches will eventually burn out the experiment's circuits, killing them.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Experiment_series">Experiment series</span></h2>
<p>The first digit of the experiment numbers reflect what series of experiment they belong to. The official series of experiments, as stated by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_Winfield" title="Jess Winfield">Jess Winfield</a>, one of the executive producers, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>0-Series:</b> Jumba's test batch, including many household helpers.</li>
<li><b>1-Series:</b> Civic disturbances.</li>
<li><b>2-Series:</b> Technological and scientific.</li>
<li><b>3-Series:</b> Psychological.</li>
<li><b>4-Series:</b> A mystery series filled by a few annoyances.</li>
<li><b>5-Series:</b> Elemental manipulators.</li>
<li><b>6-Series:</b> Battlefield or doomsday experiments with galactic implications.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the most part, the colors of the experiment pods correspond to the series numbers, however some of the pods are colored incorrectly.</p>

She behaves like a typical "good dog": does tricks, licks her owner's face, fetches the morning paper, etc. Because of her appearance and behavior, 007 was adopted by Mertle and wasn't recognized as an experiment until Jumba saw her. Her episode is named "Yapper" after the nickname Lilo gave her, but she is officially "Gigi" on the experiment name list in <i>Leroy &amp; Stitch</i>. Her one true place is with Mertle, as her pet. In <i>Leroy and Stitch</i>, it is revealed that she can speak English very well. At the end of the movie, Mertle joins Lilo and Stitch's <i><span class="unicode">ʻ</span>ohana</i> because Gigi wants to be in it with the rest of Jumba's experiments.

Designed to <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)" title="Sterilization (microbiology)">sterilize</a>, disinfect, and clean everything in sight. However, he had a problem with doing these tasks: he threw anything away, assuming it was trash, and tried to "sterilize" anyone, assuming they were germs. 010 was upgraded to try to be less of a neat-freak. Instead, he turned into a dirt-maker, so Lilo gave him to Gantu. Gantu sent 010 to Hämsterviel, who didn't like him and sent him back. Gantu set him free, and Lilo and Stitch found him. Later, after he was upgraded, they sent him <i>back</i> to Gantu, who sent him <i>back</i> to Hämsterviel, who sent him <i>back</i> to Gantu when Woops almost broke his cover. Felix was rescued later in "Snafu." The only thing that 010 can say with both of his upgrades is dirty but with Felix he says it disgustedly while with Oscar he says it happily. Both of 010's names are a reference to the main characters of <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odd_Couple" title="The Odd Couple">The Odd Couple</a></i>.

Designed to be able to sell anything to anyone. Lilo used him to get ahead in the chocolate bar selling contest/fundraiser, but Mertle took him. When Lilo took him back, Mertle took him back again. Lilo tried to take him back once more, but found out Mertle sold him to Reuben. Slick was rescued, but Lilo had to give up the contest by giving her last chocolate bar to Gantu as a swap for Slick. His one true place is at a fundraiser, following which he began working for charity, not profit. Slick was one of the experiments Lilo turned to for the capture of Ploot, but besides selling her an umbrella that she later used against Ploot, he didn't/couldn't help.

The victims retain their normal personality while under its control, and the effect immediately wears off once Checkers is removed. Lilo first donned him, but her good intentions got many people arrested by Mertle for being "troublemakers" when they accidentally disobeyed Lilo's rules. When Lilo decided to step down, Gantu took Checkers and was in power until Stitch gathered several experiments to help overthrow him. His one true place is as a decorative crown for festivals. In the Stitch! Anime, it is shown that he will jump off his wearer if he eats really spicy foods. He is voiced by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_West" title="Billy West">Billy West</a>.</td>

When Jumba had his membership revoked from E.G.O. (Evil Genius Organization), Lilo and Stitch tried to trick the head of E.G.O. into thinking that Jumba was still evil. The plan worked until the head of E.G.O. saw a screen of Ace rescuing a cat from a house on fire. His one true place is balancing out Jumba's evil and acting as a local do-gooder. His experiment number - 262- is the "opposite" of 626 - Stitch's number; Ace is pure good, and Stitch had been pure evil but Stitch is now pure good.

The plot of this game has since been <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retcon" title="Retcon" class="mw-redirect">retconned</a> from canon continuity due to the events depicting Stitch being apprehended immediately after his creation in <i>Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has A Glitch</i>.

Designed to sing a song that turns "good" experiments (i.e. rehabilitated experiments) to "bad" (i.e. evil), though it also worked on Jumba. Stitch and Reuben are immune to the song's effect, as they were created after she was. The spell can be reversed by Angel singing the song backwards or by playing a recording of her song in reverse. She is in love with Stitch and is the closest one to him. Experiment 625, Reuben, has feelings for her, calling her 'toots', 'sweet lips' and 'hotcakes,' but Angel rejected him. Angel was caught by Gantu but rescued in Snafu. In the English adaptation of the TV series <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stitch!" title="Stitch!">Stitch!</a></i>, she has moved on to become a famous singer who still manages to visit Stitch occasionally. During this series, it was discovered that her song could affect Stitch if sung in a different voice, such as when she lost her voice when she caught a cold.

He has all the powers of Stitch, but is incredibly lazy and a terrible coward, making him almost useless as a villain. His one true talent is the ability to produce large quantities of sandwiches, particularly cheese sandwiches.

<td>Leroy</td>
<td>Stitch's evil twin, with red fur, frilly ears, yellow teeth, bent antennae, three bent spines on his back, a fluffy tail, and a slightly deeper voice as well as two extra, retractable arms and retractable claws on his front paws. Jumba started creating him from a template similar to Stitch, until Dr. Hämsterviel captured him and forced him to make a "new version" of 626. Designed to have all of Stitch's powers, but he also has the ability to disguise himself as Stitch by changing his fur color from red to blue (Dr. Hämsterviel hates the color blue, so he told Jumba to make him resplendent red to match his cape) and instantly regrow his fur. Leroy is very physical, but also makes liberal use of his plasma gun. After naming him "Leroy", Dr. Hämsterviel used a cloning machine to create an army, then sent the original Leroy down to Earth to capture the 624 experiments remaining there. Stitch is shown to be a match for him as shown when they battle in Jumba's lab with Leroy only wining because Pleakley distracted Stitch and during the final battle when Leroy is outmatched by Stitch until his clones blast Stitch away. Fortunately, Jumba secretly programmed a failsafe into Leroy before he was charged: If Leroy (or his clones) hears the song "Aloha Oe", his nervous system will shut down. After his defeat, Leroy and his clones are all placed in jail with Hämsterviel. Leroy's number is never mentioned in the movie. Jumba tries to call him "627" as mentioned on the Disney website, but Gantu reminds him that he's already made experiment 627. In the commercial he is called 628, but he could actually be 629 since Jumba had already completed and locked away an experiment, numbered 628 at the end of the episode "627". He is voiced by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sanders_(director)" title="Chris Sanders (director)">Chris Sanders</a>. He and all his clones are sent to jail at the end of the movie, where they are seen happily dancing to Jailhouse Rock.</td>

Tickle-Tummy`s number is a complete mystery. She is experiment 275 in Japan, but Wormhole already has this number. She may be 628 as said on some sites. One other possibility is that perhaps she`s not accually one of Jumba`s experiments, she may have been created by Hamsterviel in Prison.
