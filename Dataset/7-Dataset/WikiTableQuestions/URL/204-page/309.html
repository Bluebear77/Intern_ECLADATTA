<p>The <b>BCL Molecular 18</b> was a range of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18-bit" title="18-bit">18-bit</a> <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a> designed and manufactured in the UK from 1970 until the late 1980s.<br />
The machines were originally manufactured by Systemation Limited and serviced by Business Mechanisation Limited. The two companies merged in 1968 to form <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_Computers_Limited&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Business Computers Limited (page does not exist)">Business Computers Limited</a> - a public limited company. Business Computers Ltd subsequently went into receivership in 1974.<br />
It was purchased from the receiver by Computer World Trade, maintenance of existing machines was by a subsidiary of CWT called CFM, manufacturing was passed to ABS Computer in the old BCL building and sales rights were sold to a team from the old Singer Computers by 1976 trading as Business Computers (Systems) Ltd selling the Molecular.<br />
BC(S) Ltd subsequently went public in 1981 to form Business Computers (Systems) Plc. Servicing and manufacturing was gradually taken over by Systemation Services/ Systemation Developments Ltd. BC(S)Plc was eventually taken over by Electronic Data Processing (EDP)</p>

<tr>
<td>Mark 1</td>
<td>1970</td>
<td>Sales Order processing</td>
<td>Architecture similar to the Data General "NOVA" in that the memory and I/O highways were separate whereas DEC used a common highway for memory and I/O with the peripherals occupying memory addresses. The NOVA was a 16 bit design but the Molecular was 18 bit allowing signed arithmetic and a memory parity check bit. The instruction set was in some ways similar to the Nova. The M18 was designed by a small team headed by Colin Chapman &amp; Ian Miller.
<p>Operating system known as LOS developed by Joe Templeman in Leicester office of Systemation. Programming was done in octal notation machine code in longhand using coding sheets. The 17 bit word allowed the limited storage of 3 bytes per word using "Metacode"</p>
</td>
<td>Ferrite core memory. from Plessey or Fabritek and later EMM.
<p>Front-loading <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_storage" title="Disk storage">disk drive</a><br />

<td>Mark 2</td>
<td>1973</td>
<td>Sales Order Processing</td>
<td>Totally new processor with hardware interrupt stacking, a variable cycle time and new disc controller. Same basic architecture as the MK1. Used a totally new OS.
<p>Water-cooled cabinets with remote chiller unit initially, later normal fan cooling.</p>
</td>
<td>Fabritek or EMM ferrite core memory. Introduced the DD1600 <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Data_Corporation" title="Control Data Corporation">CDC</a> 9427 top-loading disk drive one fixed one removable and/or a large multi-platter CDC removable disk drive.</td>

<tr>
<td>Mark 3</td>
<td></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mark 4</td>
<td></td>
<td>SOP, Livestock Markets, Paper merchants, Plumbers merchants.</td>
<td>Developed after the demise of BCL by ABS computers. Basically a 6ME in a new cabinet with lead acid battery backed static RAM instead of ferrite core.
<p>Programming still done in octal notation machine code in longhand using coding sheets.</p>
</td>
<td>Core Memory or static RAM, Introduced the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=CDC_Hawk&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="CDC Hawk (page does not exist)">CDC Hawk</a> 9427H disk drive, up to 4 supported per controller, max 2 controllers and/or a large multi-platter CDC D8000 removable disk drive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mark 5</td>
<td>1984</td>
<td>SOP, Livestock Markets, Paper merchants, Plumbers merchants.</td>
<td>Basically a re engineering of the 6ME processor to remove redundant stack logic and reduced to 3 boards with a printed circuit backplane instead of the costly wire wrapped backplane used for earlier models.
<p>Hardware re-design by Systemation Developments K. A. Howlett (Keith Alec b1943 son of W A Howlett)with assistance in the final test stages by G. Boote. Cabinet design by Business Computers Systems Ltd. Hardware designed and manufactured by Systemation Developments for Business computers Systems.</p>
</td>
<td>Initially large-format Ampex ferrite core memory then static RAM, both introduced by Systemation Developments.
<p>Later Bank switching memory introduced (32K 18 bit words base memory plus up to 8 X 32K banks).</p>
<p>First sold with CDC Hawk 9427H drives later CDC Lark 2 disk drives. Memory and new RS232 4 port I/O card (Quad I/O) by K. A. Howlett, Lark 2 disc controller by J. Adams. Up to four CDC Lark or Amcodyne drives per controller, max 2 controllers.</p>

<td>1986</td>
<td>SOP, Livestock Markets, Paper merchants, Plumbers merchants.</td>
<td>Smaller version of the Mark 5 in an oversized PC style vertical cabinet with a CDC Lark 2 drive built in. Designed and manufactured by Systemation Developments K. A. Howlett for Business Computers Systems. A single board processor was developed to replace the 3 card processor and was working but never came to market. At the same time a Transputer based maths co-processor had also been developed. Assembler programming introduced by Systemation Developments with the aid of a third party, running on PC's with the program then downloaded to the M18.</td>
<td>Support for seven additional external Lark 2 or Amcodyne drives 4 per controller including the integral drive. 32K 18 bit words of base memory plus up to 8 32K banks.</td>
