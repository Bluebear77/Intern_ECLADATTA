<p>Ever since people have traveled the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes_(North_America)" title="Great Lakes (North America)" class="mw-redirect">Great Lakes</a> storms have taken lives and vessels. The first sailing vessel on the upper lakes, the <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Griffon" title="Le Griffon">Le Griffon</a></i>, was lost on its return from <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_(Lake_Michigan)" title="Green Bay (Lake Michigan)">Green Bay</a> in 1679. Since that time, memorable storms have swept the lakes, often in November taking men and ships to their death. With the advent of modern technology and sturdier vessels, fewer such losses have occurred.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The large expanse of the lakes allows waves to build to substantial heights and the open water can alter weather systems (<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog" title="Fog">fog</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_effect_snow" title="Lake effect snow" class="mw-redirect">lake effect snow</a>).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lake_Erie_Gale_.281811.29">Lake Erie Gale (1811)</span></h2>
<p>It was September 1811 and Jacob Butler was headed to <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandusky,_Ohio" title="Sandusky, Ohio">Sandusky, Ohio</a> as the new Indian Agent. When he arrived in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo</a>, he found it to be a small town of 40-50 houses and little activity. There were but a few ships in the harbor. The <i>Catherine</i> was a new schooner that had set sail the day before, but was now anchored nine miles up the Canadian shore at Point Ebenew. As it had set sail, it encountered a west forcing it to seek shelter. Seeing an opportunity to avoid the long trip around the lake, he crossed the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_River" title="Niagara River">Niagara River</a> and with the help of a guide came upon the ship at anchor after two hours. Soon they were underway with a steady breeze pushing them towards Sandusky.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The ship was packed and every possible space in which a person could find repose was occupied. All night they traveled westward, the ship pushed by the wind and the schooner rocking from side to side. With so many people, so closely packed, many became nauseated. The next day, they traveled westward. As night fell on their second day of travel, they expected to see Sandusky in the morning. Everyone had just settled down for the night, when a commotion arose and a gale blew out of the southwest, nearly tipping the vessel over. If the schooner had not been ‘hove to’ and resting quietly, it would have been capsized.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> (Without shore lights, lighthouse, or modern navigation equipment, Captains would ‘heave to’ at night if they anticipated approaching land/harbor soon. This prevented them from running aground in the dark.)</p>
<p>Quickly the crew made the <i>Catherine</i> ready for the storm and let her drift before the winds. As daylight came, the captain was able to get his ship behind <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presque_Isle_State_Park" title="Presque Isle State Park">Presque Isle</a> (<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie,_Pennsylvania" title="Erie, Pennsylvania">Erie, Pennsylvania</a>), where they rode out the storm for the next 24 hours. The winds persisted so fiercely that everything on deck was swept clear. The crew and passengers remained below deck in the dark, their supply of food gone. On the fourth day of his journey, the gale ended and they were able to resupply from shore. Setting sail for Sandusky, the hope was to make harbor by dark. Once again a gale of lesser force sprang up and pushed the vessel back to Presque Isle. Here, many of the passengers left the ship and hired a wagon for the two-week overland trip. On their next attempt to reach Sandusky, the <i>Catherine</i> made harbor without incident.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>It was September 1825 when <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Rowe_Schoolcraft" title="Henry Rowe Schoolcraft" class="mw-redirect">Henry Rowe Schoolcraft</a> recorded a late fall storm on <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Huron" title="Lake Huron">Lake Huron</a>. He was returning from an Indian ‘Congress’ at <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_du_Chien,_Wisconsin" title="Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin">Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin</a>. It had been an uneventful six-day trip from the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> to <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michilimackinac" title="Michilimackinac">Michilimackinac</a>. From Mackinac, Schoolcraft was headed towards Detour Pass and up the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Marys_River_(Michigan-Ontario)" title="St. Marys River (Michigan-Ontario)" class="mw-redirect">St. Mary's River</a> to <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sault_Ste._Marie,_Michigan" title="Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a>. On the morning of 5 September, he arose, had breakfast and prepared to strike out in their canoes. The day was cloudy and threatening, so he decided to wait until the next day. Arising at three in the morning, he found the island lost in a fog. They waited until it began to clear at 6:30 a.m. and made their way to Goose Island, ten miles (16&#160;km) distance after three hours. From there, they made their way to Outard Point. Here, the headwind had increased so they <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaving_to" title="Heaving to">hove to</a> about noon and were able to pull into an inlet out of the wind and make camp. Eight hours later, the canoe party was still waiting for the wind to let up. The night brought a heavy rain, piercing the fabric of the tents, soaking everyone and everything. The morning of the 7th found the storm continuing. The increasing violence caused Schoolcraft to have his tent moved back into the trees for more protection. Around three, the sky seemed to be brightening and expectations were that the weather was clearing. But the rains and the wind came with renewed fury from the west and continued late into the night. As the morning of the 8th arrived, Schoolcraft determined to get on with his journey. As the wind was directly out of the west, he was headed east, he ordered the canoes readied and the sails. With sails <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefing" title="Reefing">reefed</a> against the storm, the brigade set out into the lake at 10:00 a.m. Just under three and a half hours brought them 20 miles to the Isle St. Vital, behind which they took refuge from the wind. After a break, they once again set into the gale force winds, driving for De Tour and the St. Mary’s Strait. Here they found the schooner <i>Harriet</i>, down bound, waiting for the winds to subside. It was but another day and they were once again at Sault Ste. Marie.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>On November 11, 1835, a southwest wind swept across the lakes, taking numerous vessels. This was still early in the life of commercial shipping on the Lakes, so most of the losses were on the lower lakes where settlements were greatest.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo</a> was a major port on <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Erie" title="Lake Erie">Lake Erie</a> and felt the force of the storm as water from the lake forced ships onto the piers and shoreline of the city.

<p>It was Saturday, November 25, 1905 when the <i>Joseph G. Butler, Jr.</i> set sail for the first time from the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ship_Building_Company" title="American Ship Building Company">American Ship Building Company</a>’s <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorain,_Ohio" title="Lorain, Ohio">Lorain</a> yards. It was the newest vessel on the lakes.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Through the night, the vessel continued northward, up the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_River" title="Detroit River">Detroit River</a> and entering <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Saint_Clair_(North_America)" title="Lake Saint Clair (North America)" class="mw-redirect">Lake St. Clair</a> as dawn broke. By noon, November 26, the <i>Butler</i> emerged from the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Clair_River" title="St. Clair River">St. Clair River</a> into <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Huron" title="Lake Huron">Lake Huron</a>. The sky was gray and overcast. For the rest of Sunday, the <i>Butler</i> steamed north across Lake Huron. On the morning of Monday, November 27, the <i>Butler</i> passed <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Detour_Reef_Light&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Detour Reef Light (page does not exist)">Detour Reef Light</a> and entered the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Marys_River_(Michigan-Ontario)" title="St. Marys River (Michigan-Ontario)" class="mw-redirect">Saint Marys River</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Monday afternoon, the <i>Butler</i> cleared the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soo_Locks" title="Soo Locks">Soo Locks</a>, just behind the <i>Bransford</i>. That afternoon, the temperature was 28 degrees (-2 degrees C).<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> As the two steamers headed across <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitefish_Bay" title="Whitefish Bay">Whitefish Bay</a>, the barometer started downward, then the bottom fell out and the snow thickened. By dusk, the lookouts could barely make out the light at <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitefish_Point" title="Whitefish Point" class="mw-redirect">Whitefish Point</a> as they cleared the bay into the body of Lake Superior. Here the <i>Bransford</i> turned northward to follow the Canadian shore to stay north of the storm. The <i>Butler</i> turned southwestward to take the shorter distance and pressed through the storm.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As the <i>Butler</i> sighted the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribou_Island_Light" title="Caribou Island Light">Caribou Island Light</a>, the shuddering of the ship changed. The continuous pounding of the waves on the side of the ship became interspersed with a violent shaking. Down in the engine room, the Chief Engineer knew that the vibration was from the props rising out of the water as a trough between waves running up to 10 and 2 feet. First the propeller would rise out of the water, and then the spinning blades would crash back into the water. This kind of pounding could open every seam in the vessel. It became his job to stop the blades every time they rose out of the water and get them going again once they were below the surface. If the ship were to lose headway, it would be at the mercy of the storm, but if the vibrations weren’t stopped, the ship would come apart on its own.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> The next obstacle was <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keweenaw_Point&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Keweenaw Point (page does not exist)">Keweenaw Point</a> jutting out into the open lake.

<p>All day Tuesday the 28th, the <i>Butler</i> fought the boiling seas. At one point, with land not seen and fear of approaching a point of land, the <i>Butler</i> turned to run with the storm, hoping to clear any unseen shoreline. Late that day, the storm began to abate, and when the captain could once again see across the lake, the light at Outer Island in the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle_Islands" title="Apostle Islands">Apostles</a> was spotted. Now a new course was set to make for Duluth.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> The seas were still high, but the wind had let up and the snow had stopped. Some fifty hours out of Lorain, the <i>Butler</i> was once again on a steady course for Duluth. As they came abreast of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Harbors,_Minnesota" title="Two Harbors, Minnesota">Two Harbor</a>, the <i>Bransford</i> was spotted making for Duluth.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> Further ahead another steamer was spotted. This turned out to be the <i>Perry G. Walker</i>, which had sailed from Duluth just two days earlier.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Approaching Duluth, more freighters were spotted. The <i>James Nasmyth</i> was anchored out from <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Point" title="Minnesota Point">Minnesota Point</a>, sitting low in the water with a load of iron ore and a thick coating of ice. Then the bulk freighter <i>Mataafa</i> was spotted, sitting in the shallows of Minnesota Point and split into several parts. It was noon as the <i>Butler</i> steamed through the canal into <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St._Louis_Bay_(Wisconsin-Minnesota)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="St. Louis Bay (Wisconsin-Minnesota) (page does not exist)">St. Louis Bay</a>, the <i>R.W.

<p>The weekend looked ominous across the breadth of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Superior" title="Lake Superior">Lake Superior</a>. But seldom did big storms follow on the tail of another big storm, so the captains finished loading and headed out onto the lake. As darkness settled over the lake on Monday evening, November 27, the weather changed abruptly. At 7:00 p.m., a northeast gale slammed across the lake. Starting with 44&#160;mph winds (70&#160;km/h), they quickly rose to 60 and 70&#160;mph (86–112&#160;km/h). For nearly 12 hours, the winds stayed above 60 miles-per-hour. Before the storm ended on the 28, seventeen ships were stranded, a dozen damaged and 32 men gone.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Once out on the lakes, each ship had only itself to depend upon and the chance of meeting another ship.

It was 1:10 in the morning as the <i>Colgate</i> dropped its <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawser" title="Hawser">hawsers</a> and headed out into the open lake. Dawn found the <i>Colgate</i> off Long Point. All day they moved steadily westward, keeping the bow into the wind, waves crashing over the decks and beating on the hatch coverings. Slowing, water began to enter the cargo holds. The pumps could not keep up with the influx of water and she began to list at about eight o'clock that evening. No other ships had been seen and none could be found. The bow was riding low in the water. As the ten o'clock hour came around, the <i>Colgate</i> slid beneath the waves. The men all had life jackets, but nothing was floating which would help them get out of the cold water. One life raft was found and a coal passer, the engineer and the captain took refuge. In the middle of the night, the raft was flipped and the coal passer did not return. As the 21st dawned, the raft again spilled its occupants and the engineer returned but was too weak to hold on and he was lost. Night came on and Captain Walter J. Grashaw still hung on to the raft. A passenger steamer passed nearby, but he was unnoticed in the dark. As daylight dawned on the 22nd, Sunday, the Marquette &amp; Bessemer No. 2 came to his rescue.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The wooden ship could not take the pounding of the waves. Settling into the lake, soon the boilers were extinguished and the <i>Butters</i> was at the mercy of the storm. Ten men set sail in the lifeboat, leaving only the captain and two men on board the sinking vessel. The Pioneer Steamship Company’s <i>Frank R. Billings</i> and the <i>F.G. Hartwell</i> were nearby. The <i>Billings</i> approached to give aid. Pouring <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Storm_oil&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Storm oil (page does not exist)">storm oil</a> on the water, they were able to calm the seas enough to rescue Captain McClure and his two men.

Just off Bar Point, within sight of the mouth of the Detroit River, the pumps could no longer move the volume of water rushing into the holds, and the seams began to open. In eighteen feet of water, she settled to the bottom. Six men climbed the foremast, while the captain climbed the after mast. It looked like all seven of the crew could cling to the mast and weather the night. But the weight of six men snapped the fore mast and five disappeared. Only one man made it to the after mast and climbed to safety. As dawn broke the horizon, the <i>Western States</i> came into sight and turned towards the two men clinging to the mast protruding from the shallows. As the steamer approached, one man slipped from the mast and was never seen again.

The <i>Arthur M. Anderson</i> joined her on Lake Superior and was downbound for <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary,_Indiana" title="Gary, Indiana">Gary, Indiana</a>. As they were crossing Lake Superior the winter storm blew in. Winds were reported in excess of 50 knots (58&#160;mph/93&#160;km/h) with waves running up to 35 feet (10 m). The next day, Monday, November 10, eastern Lake Superior was still experiencing winds of 50 knots. That afternoon the <i>Anderson</i> reported being hit by a 75-knot gust. By 3:30 pm the <i>Fitzgerald</i> reported a minor list and top-side damage, including the loss of radar. The <i>Fitzgerald</i> was leading, but slowed to close the distance between ships so that it could be guided by the <i>Anderson</i>, who still had radar. Just after seven that night, the last radio contact from the <i>Fitzgerald</i> said that they were still managing. By 7:20 p.m. there was no more contact and the <i>Anderson</i> no longer saw the <i>Fitzgerald</i> on radar.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> Fitzgerald sank in Canadian waters 530 feet (160 m) deep, approximately 17 miles (15 nautical miles; 27 kilometers) from the entrance to Whitefish Bay near the twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Although Fitzgerald had reported being in difficulty earlier, no distress signals were sent before she sank. Her crew of 29 all perished, and no bodies were recovered. Many theories, books, studies and expeditions have examined the cause of the sinking. Fitzgerald may have fallen victim to the high waves of the storm, suffered structural failure, been swamped with water entering through her cargo hatches or deck, experienced topside damage, or shoaled in a shallow part of Lake Superior. The sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald is one of the best-known disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_.22Chiclone.22_.282010.29">The "Chiclone" (2010)</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2010_North_American_storm_complex" title="October 2010 North American storm complex">October 2010 North American storm complex</a></div>
<p>On October 26, 2010, the USA recorded its lowest pressure ever in a continental, non-hurricane system, though its pressure was consistent with a category three hurricane. The powerful system was dubbed the "Chiclone" by the media as it hit the Chicago area particularly strongly, as well as Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. It was also meteorologically referred to as a bombogenesis due to the rapid drop of barometric pressure experienced.</p>
<p>In Superior, Wisconsin, the storm managed a 28.38 inch reading---a new all time low for Wisconsin at the time. Near International Falls on the U.S./Canadian border, the system's 28.23 inch (956 mb) reading established a new all-time Minnesota low pressure. Early Tuesday morning October 26, an F2 tornado rushed through Will County, south of Chicago, at 7:00 AM. Another tornado is said to have struck Racine, Wisconsin, to the north, but has not yet been confirmed. In Roscoe, IL, about 100 miles to the west of Chicago and 15 minutes north of Rockford, a woman was killed after being crushed under a large tree that fell in her neighborhood of Chickory Ridge.</p>
<p>The storm also produced some of the highest officially recorded waves by weather buoys stationed in Lakes Superior and Michigan. Specifically, on Wednesday, October 27, 2010, buoy no. 45136, operated by Environment Canada, in northern Lake Superior recorded a significant wave height of 26.6 feet (this is average height of 1/3 of the highest waves over an hour), and buoy no. 45002, operated by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), recorded a significant wave height of 21.7 feet in northern Lake Michigan. This would appear consistent with the NOAA forecast for northern Lake Michigan calling for 21–26 foot waves that day. The persistence and strength of the storm's westerly winds also piled the waters of Lake Michigan along the Michigan shoreline leading to declines in lake levels on the Illinois and Wisconsin side of the lake. Based on NOAA lake level sensors, an updated analysis of Wednesday, October 27, 2010 water levels on Lake Michigan revealed a two-day decrease of 42 inches at Green Bay, WI and 19 inches at Calumet Harbor, IL---while NOAA sensors at Ludington, MI and Mackinaw City, MI measured lake level rises of 7 and 19 inches respectively.</p>
<p>A 78&#160;mph gust was recorded the afternoon of October 27, 2010 at the Harrison-Dever Crib, three miles offshore of Chicago in Lake Michigan, with gusts reaching 63&#160;mph at Chicago's Latin School and in Racine, Wisconsin, 61&#160;mph at Buffalo Grove, Waukegan, Gary and Monroe, Wisconsin and 58&#160;mph at Hinsdale. The storm further whitened sections of the Upper Midwest with the region's first significant snow Tuesday night and Wednesday. Snowfall reports from Minnesota and North Dakota indicate 9 inches fell at Twig, Minn.; 8.5 inches at Dunn Center, N.D.; 8 inches at Adolph, Minn. and Carrington, N.D.; 7.7 inches at Duluth; 4.1 inches Williston; 4 inches at Minot and 3.4 inches at Bismarck---all in North Dakota.</p>
