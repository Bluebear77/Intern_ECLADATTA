Multiple picocell 'heads' connect to each BSC: the BSC performs radio resource management and hand-over functions, and aggregates data to be passed to the [[Network switching subsystem#Mobile switching center (MSC)|mobile switching centre]] (MSC) or the gateway [[GPRS]] support node ([[GPRS core network#Gateway GPRS support node (GGSN)|GGSN]]).\n\nConnectivity between the picocell heads and the BSC typically consists of in-building wiring. Although originally deployed systems (1990s) used [[plesiochronous digital hierarchy]] (PDH) links such as E1/T1 links, more recent systems use [[Ethernet]] cabling. Aircraft use satellite links.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.radio-electronics.com/analysis/satellite/2010-04/thales-in-flight-connectivity.php |title= In-flight picocell connectivity |accessdate= 2010-12-21 |publisher= Radio-Electronics |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101007182018/http://radio-electronics.com/analysis/satellite/2010-04/thales-in-flight-connectivity.php |archive-date= 2010-10-07 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nMore recent work has developed the concept towards a head unit containing not only a picocell, but also many of the functions of the BSC and some of the MSC. This form of picocell is sometimes called an [[access point base station]] or 'enterprise [[femtocell]]'. In this case, the unit contains all the capability required to connect directly to the Internet, without the need for the BSC/MSC infrastructure. This is a potentially more cost-effective approach.\n\nPicocells offer many of the benefits of \"[[small cell]]s\" (similar to femtocells) in that they improve data throughput for mobile users and increase capacity in the mobile network. In particular, the integration of picocells with macrocells through a heterogeneous network can be useful in seamless hand-offs and increased mobile data capacity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mobile Experts Picocell Forecast|url=http://mobile-experts.net/product_info.php?products_id=41}}</ref>\n\nPicocells are available for most cellular technologies including GSM, CDMA, UMTS and LTE from manufacturers including [[ip.access]], ZTE, Huawei and Airwalk.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.abiresearch.com/research/1003580-Picocell+Equipment+Vendor+Matrix |title= picocell vendor matrix |accessdate= 2010-12-21 |publisher= ABI Research |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718112342/http://www.abiresearch.com/research/1003580-Picocell+Equipment+Vendor+Matrix |archive-date= 2011-07-18 |url-status= dead }}</ref>"
