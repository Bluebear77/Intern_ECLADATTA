In November 2008, [[Qualcomm]], UMB's lead sponsor, announced it was ending development of the technology, favoring [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] instead.<ref>Qualcomm halts UMB project, Reuters, 13 November 2008</ref>\n\n3GPP2 should not be confused with [[3GPP]]; 3GPP is the standard body behind the [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS) that is the 3G upgrade to [[GSM]] networks, while 3GPP2 was the standard body behind the competing 3G standard [[CDMA2000]] that is the 3G upgrade to [[cdmaOne]] networks that was used mostly in the United States (and to some extent also in Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and India).\n\nGSM/UMTS were the most widespread 2G/3G wireless standards worldwide. Most countries used only the GSM family. A few countries, including China, the United States, Canada, Ukraine, [[Trinidad and Tobago]], India, South Korea and Japan, used both sets of standards.\n\n3GPP2 had its last activity in 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/SC/techweb.cfm|title=3GPP2 Technology Webinar|website=3GPP2}}</ref> and the group has been dormant ever since. The 3GPP2 website has been taken offline in 2023, primarily due to CDMA carriers deploying [[3GPP]]'s [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] instead of UMB the decade prior and later shutting down CDMA networks making the 3GPP2 redundant and unneeded."
