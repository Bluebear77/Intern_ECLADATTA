Regarding the change, James said:<blockquote>\"The engineering side of it was an issue. All of our code is [[.NET Framework|.NET]]/XNA, and, even though XNA support has ended, .NET games can use open source wrappers like MonoGame and FNA to carry the torch. But Xbox One has no .NET support. PS4 does, with titles like Towerfall: Ascension and Transistor using MonoGame in one form or another to deploy to PS4.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/28/ska-studios-shifts-to-sony-after-6-years-on-xbox/|title=Ska Studios shifts to Sony after 6 years on Xbox|website=Engadget|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref></blockquote>"
