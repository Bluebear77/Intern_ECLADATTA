Run Run Shaw later moved to Hong Kong in the 1950s to run [[Shaw Brothers Studio]], whilst Runme Shaw stayed in Singapore to continue Shaw Organisation's operations. Unlike Tianyi,<ref>{{cite web|title=1925: The Start of a Legendary Studio|url=http://www.chinesemirror.com/index/2011/04/1925-start-legendary-studio.html|website=The Chinese Mirror|accessdate=24 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419144255/http://www.chinesemirror.com/index/2011/04/1925-start-legendary-studio.html|archivedate=19 April 2015}}</ref> Shaw Organisation does not produce films but distribute them in their theatres.\n\n==History==\nShaw Organisation has a long history in Singapore since its founding in 1924. They bought the land which the Shaw House now stands in the year 1952. The plot of land was originally granted to William Scott in 1845. About 500,000 square feet of land was levelled original Shaw House and the adjacent Lido Theatre.\n\nThe company managed single-screen cinemas until the late 1980s, when it decided to build [[Multiplex (movie theatre)|cineplexes]] to give more flexibility in offering different types of films.  The first cineplexes built were the Prince and Jade cineplexes in Shaw Towers, opened in February 1988. Cineplexes have now become the standard for cinemas offering varied shows for smaller crowds.\n\nThe Shaw Organisation was founded in 1924 when Tan [[Runme Shaw]] (1901–1985) arrived in Singapore from Shanghai. He was the third of seven children of a Shanghai textile merchant, Shaw Yuh Hsuen (1867–1920).\n\nIn Shanghai, Runme's eldest brother [[Runje Shaw]] had founded the [[Tianyi Film Company]] (aka Unique). Not satisfied with the domestic market, the Shaw brothers sought business opportunities elsewhere, especially South-East Asia. Runme, as distribution manager was tasked to search for a suitable investment city. Runme's original destination was Indochina where he hoped to meet with the film distributors. However, he was denied permission to land there and instead, he ended up in Singapore, creating the Shaw Organisation. He was joined by his younger brother Sir Run Run Shaw two years later.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chung|first1=S.P.|title=Moguls of the Chinese Cinema: The Story of the Shaw Brothers in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore|date=2002|publisher=Modern Asian Studies|page=665}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Great Depression]], the Shaws decided to diversify their risk by branching out from their entertainment business into areas like amusement parks. They brought in ideas from abroad and modelled the parks after those in Shanghai, which proved to be popular amongst the local population.\n\nFrom the mid 30s to the 80s, Shaw operated two popular fairgrounds – the [[Great World Amusement Park]] and the [[New World Amusement Park]].\n\nAt its height, the company owned multiple cinemas and amusement parks throughout Singapore, [[Malaysia]] and [[Borneo]], and spawned [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] in Hong Kong to feed its then-burgeoning operation.\n\nBy August 2000, a computerised ticketing system developed jointly with Singapore Computer Systems was launched. This system linked all Shaw theatres into a single network for automated telephone credit card purchases.

By August 2000, a computerised ticketing system developed jointly with Singapore Computer Systems was launched. This system linked all Shaw theatres into a single network for automated telephone credit card purchases. With her extensive infrastructure, Shaw is now the biggest distributor of Asian cinema.

The plot of land was originally granted to William Scott in 1845. About 500,000 square feet of land was levelled original Shaw House and the adjacent Lido Theatre.\n\nThe company managed single-screen cinemas until the late 1980s, when it decided to build [[Multiplex (movie theatre)|cineplexes]] to give more flexibility in offering different types of films.  The first cineplexes built were the Prince and Jade cineplexes in Shaw Towers, opened in February 1988. Cineplexes have now become the standard for cinemas offering varied shows for smaller crowds.\n\nThe Shaw Organisation was founded in 1924 when Tan [[Runme Shaw]] (1901–1985) arrived in Singapore from Shanghai. He was the third of seven children of a Shanghai textile merchant, Shaw Yuh Hsuen (1867–1920).\n\nIn Shanghai, Runme's eldest brother [[Runje Shaw]] had founded the [[Tianyi Film Company]] (aka Unique). Not satisfied with the domestic market, the Shaw brothers sought business opportunities elsewhere, especially South-East Asia. Runme, as distribution manager was tasked to search for a suitable investment city. Runme's original destination was Indochina where he hoped to meet with the film distributors. However, he was denied permission to land there and instead, he ended up in Singapore, creating the Shaw Organisation. He was joined by his younger brother Sir Run Run Shaw two years later.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chung|first1=S.P.|title=Moguls of the Chinese Cinema: The Story of the Shaw Brothers in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore|date=2002|publisher=Modern Asian Studies|page=665}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Great Depression]], the Shaws decided to diversify their risk by branching out from their entertainment business into areas like amusement parks. They brought in ideas from abroad and modelled the parks after those in Shanghai, which proved to be popular amongst the local population.\n\nFrom the mid 30s to the 80s, Shaw operated two popular fairgrounds – the [[Great World Amusement Park]] and the [[New World Amusement Park]].\n\nAt its height, the company owned multiple cinemas and amusement parks throughout Singapore, [[Malaysia]] and [[Borneo]], and spawned [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] in Hong Kong to feed its then-burgeoning operation.\n\nBy August 2000, a computerised ticketing system developed jointly with Singapore Computer Systems was launched. This system linked all Shaw theatres into a single network for automated telephone credit card purchases. With her extensive infrastructure, Shaw is now the biggest distributor of Asian cinema.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Curtin|first1=Michael|title=Playing to the World's Biggest Audience: The Globalization of Chinese Film and TV|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> Today, it manages and runs 70 screens in 7 locations in Singapore."
