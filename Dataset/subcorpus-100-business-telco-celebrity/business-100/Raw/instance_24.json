It had offices in London, [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], and [[Alderley Edge]] ([[Cheshire]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1975, CAP UK split from CAP Europe, a partnership formed in 1966 with CAP France, which was a separately-founded company. The name 'CAP' in Europe remained with [[Capgemini|CAP Gemini Sogeti]]. CAP UK formed CAP International, which operated outside Europe and had several branches in the Middle East.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, d'Agapeyeff recognised the potential of [[microprocessor]]s and the newly developed [[microcomputer]]s. He created [[Business Operating System (software)|BOS]] (Business Operating System), a portable environment to run commercial software on the emerging microcomputers. In 1976, CAP Microsoft was formed to market services based on BOS and MicroCobol.\n\nIn 1978, CPP (Computer Program Products) was formed to sell [[IBM]] mainframe products and subsequently CAP was renamed CAP-CPP to distinguish itself from the European CAP, but later it changed to CAP Group.\n\n[[CAP Scientific]], which did defence-related work, was formed in 1979.\n\nBy the late 1980s, CAP Group PLC consisted of the following:<ref name=BriefIntroduction/>\n*CAP Financial Services Ltd, with offices in London and Watford.\n*CAP Industry Ltd, with offices in Reading, London, Wilmslow, Manchester and the Netherlands.\n*CAP Scientific Ltd, with offices in London and Dorchester.\n*YARD Ltd, with offices in [[Elmbank Gardens|Charing Cross Tower]] in Glasgow, Chippenham, Aberdeen, Bristol, and Bath.

Its first job was the creation of a version of [[ALGOL 60|ALGOL]] for the [[English Electric]] [[KDF6]] computer, and later the [[Elliott 503]].<ref>\"Crisis, What Crisis?\" Reconsidering the Software Crisis of the 1960s and the Origins of Software Engineering http://tomandmaria.com/tom/Writing/SoftwareCrisis_SofiaDRAFT.pdf</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrocomputingtasmania.com/home/projects/elliott-503/anecdotes |title=Elliott 503 anecdotes |publisher=retroComputingTasmania |date=30 December 2003 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref> During the 1960s it produced [[CORAL]] compilers and a real time operating system for the [[Royal Navy]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nd'Agapeyeff coined the term '[[middleware]]' to describe the interface between application and system software at a presentation to a [[NATO]] conference in 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://icse08.upb.de/downloads/ICSE08-40yRandellMiddleware.pdf |title=Some Middleware Beginnings |date=15 May 2008 |author=Brian Randell |accessdate=28 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001745/http://icse08.upb.de/downloads/ICSE08-40yRandellMiddleware.pdf |archive-date=31 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBy 1974, CAP operated three divisions – commercial, financial, and industrial – which covered mainframe and minicomputer systems and industrial control systems. It had offices in London, [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], and [[Alderley Edge]] ([[Cheshire]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1975, CAP UK split from CAP Europe, a partnership formed in 1966 with CAP France, which was a separately-founded company. The name 'CAP' in Europe remained with [[Capgemini|CAP Gemini Sogeti]]. CAP UK formed CAP International, which operated outside Europe and had several branches in the Middle East.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, d'Agapeyeff recognised the potential of [[microprocessor]]s and the newly developed [[microcomputer]]s. He created [[Business Operating System (software)|BOS]] (Business Operating System), a portable environment to run commercial software on the emerging microcomputers. In 1976, CAP Microsoft was formed to market services based on BOS and MicroCobol.\n\nIn 1978, CPP (Computer Program Products) was formed to sell [[IBM]] mainframe products and subsequently CAP was renamed CAP-CPP to distinguish itself from the European CAP, but later it changed to CAP Group.\n\n[[CAP Scientific]], which did defence-related work, was formed in 1979.\n\nBy the late 1980s, CAP Group PLC consisted of the following:<ref name=BriefIntroduction/>\n*CAP Financial Services Ltd, with offices in London and Watford.\n*CAP Industry Ltd, with offices in Reading, London, Wilmslow, Manchester and the Netherlands.\n*CAP Scientific Ltd, with offices in London and Dorchester.\n*YARD Ltd, with offices in [[Elmbank Gardens|Charing Cross Tower]] in Glasgow, Chippenham, Aberdeen, Bristol, and Bath.  YARD Ltd and YARD International Ltd became part of CAP Group when CAP merged with [[Yarrow PLC]] in mid-1986.\n**YARD International Ltd, with offices in London, Canada and the USA.\n**[[CORDA (UK)|CORDA Ltd]] was a business unit jointly owned by CAP Scientific and YARD.\n*Data Networks Ltd, with offices in Tipton and London.\n*Baddeley Associates Ltd, with offices in Cambridge.\n\nIn the late 1980s, 84% of CAP's turnover was in the UK, and 16% overseas.  The turnover by market was:<ref name=BriefIntroduction/>\n*Science and engineering 37.7%\n*Industry 31.2%\n*Financial services 17.7%\n*Information services 13.4%\n\n\n\nIn 1988, CAP merged with Sema-Metra, a French company and the merged group was called [[Sema Group]].<ref>CAP Group merged with Sema-Metra to form Sema Group in a deal valued at £93.7 million ($177.1 million US). To effect the transaction, CAP Group offered 24 ordinary shares for each Sema-Metra share held. French shareholders received 55% of Cap Group's stock. Paribas, which advised Sema-Metra in the transaction, saw its stake reduced from 70% of SEMA-Metra to 40% of SEMA Group.<br />CAP Group PLC launches a tender offer for Sema-Metra SA, Thomson Financial Mergers & Acquisitions, 29 Apr 1988<br />Note that the summary on the webpage is potentially misleading:\n* it refers to 'Sema-Matra' – a typing or scanning error,\n* it refers to 'Schlumberger Ltd' – the company that later acquired SEMA Group; this is no doubt because of the way the information was stored inside Thomson Financial Mergers & Acquisitions databases.</ref><ref>Sema originally stood for: Société d'économie et de mathématiques appliquées.</ref> The name 'CAP' was dropped because it could not be used in Europe."
