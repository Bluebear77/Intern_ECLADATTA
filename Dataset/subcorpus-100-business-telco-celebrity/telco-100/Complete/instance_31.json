The Orange brand originated in the United Kingdom in 1994 after [[Hutchison Whampoa]] acquired a controlling stake in [[Orange UK|Microtel Communications]]: that company became a subsidiary of [[Mannesmann]] in 1999 and then was acquired by France Télécom in 2000.

That was the optical [[telegraphy]] network of [[Claude Chappe]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dilhac |first=J-M. |title=The Telegraph of Claude Chappe -an Optical Telecommunication Network for the Xviiith Century |url=https://mathcs.holycross.edu/~csci356/Dilhac.pdf |website=Mathematics, Computer Science, Statistics - College of the Holy Cross}}</ref>\n\nIn 1878, after the invention of the electrical telegraph and then the invention of the telephone, the French State created a [[Postes, télégraphes et téléphones (France)|Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs]]. Telephone Services were added to the ministry when they were nationalised in 1889. However, it was not until 1923 that the second 'T' (for 'telephones') appeared and the department of P&T became PTT.\n\nIn 1941, a General Direction of Telecommunications was created within this ministry. Then, in 1944, the National Centre of Telecommunications Studies (CNET) was created to develop the telecommunications industry in France.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nIn the 1970s, France attempted to make up for its delay in developing communications infrastructure, compared to other countries, by launching the programme \"Delta LP\" (increasing the main lines).{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} It was at that time that the majority of the local loop was built (that is all the cables linking the users to the operator). Moreover, with the help of French manufacturers, digital switching -- [[Minitel]] and the [[GSM]] standard --  were invented by engineers and CNET researchers.\n\nIn 1982, Telecom introduced [[Minitel]] [[Online shopping|online ordering]] for its customers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/28/minitel-france-says-farewell|title=France says farewell to the Minitel – the little box that connected a country|last=Chrisafis|first=Angelique|date=28 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=11 January 2018|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Creation of France Télécom (1988–1997) ===\nUntil 1988, France Télécom was known as the ''direction générale des Télécommunications'', a division of the [[Postes, télégraphes et téléphones (France)|Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications]]. It became autonomous in 1990. This was in response to a European directive, aimed at making competition mandatory in public services from 1 January 1998. The 2 July 1990 Bill changed France Télécom into an operator of public law, with Marcel Roulet the first Chairman. Since then, the company has had a separate body corporate from the State and acquired financial autonomy. It was privatised by [[Lionel Jospin]]'s [[Plural Left]] government starting on 1 January 1998. The [[Cabinet of France|French government]], both directly and through its [[holding company]] [[Entreprise de recherches et d'activités pétrolières|ERAP]], continues to hold a stake of almost 27% in the company.

A second share offering occurred in 1998. France Télécom got behind in the internationalization launched by its international competitors such as [[Vodafone]], thus, it started looking for targets at the highest [[speculation]] rate of the dot-com bubble. Moreover, its alliance with [[Deutsche Telekom]] based on a reciprocal capital contribution of 2% broke off when [[Deutsche Telekom]] announced that they were planning to do business with [[Telecom Italia]] without letting the French know; even if this project ended up failing.\n\n=== Acquisition of Orange and privatisation ===\n{{see also|Orange UK#History}}\n<timeline>\n\n#init\n\nImageSize  = width:1000 height:250\nPlotArea   = left:95 right:40 bottom:20 top:20\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:mm/yyyy\nAlignBars  = late\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:31/12/1989 till:01/06/2011\n\n#colors\nColors =\n id:canvas value:gray(0.95)        # background for whole image\n id:bars   value:gray(0.95)        # background for bars\n id:grid1  value:rgb(0.4,0.6,0.4)  # major grid\n id:grid2  value:rgb(0.80,0.80,1)  # minor grid\n id:gray   value:gray(0.6)         # for colophon\n id:gray2  value:gray(0.5)         # for text\n\nBackgroundColors = canvas:canvas bars:bars\nScaleMajor  = gridcolor:grid1 unit:year  increment:1 start:31/12/1989\nScaleMinor  = gridcolor:grid2 unit:month increment:3 start:31/12/1989\n\n#Bar\nBarData =\n  bar:Nom  text:Name\n  bar:Actionnaires  text:Shareholders\n  bar:Faits  text:Key facts\n\n#plot\n\nPlotData=\n  bar:Nom from:start till:01/04/1994 color:redorange text:\"Microtel Communications Ltd\" align:center align:center width:45\n  bar:Nom from:01/04/1994 till:01/08/2000 color:orange text:\"Orange plc\" align:center align:center width:45\n  bar:Nom from:01/08/2000 till:end color:redorange text:\"Orange SA\" align:center align:center width:45\n  bar:Actionnaires from:start till:01/07/1991 color:redorange text:\"Microtel\" align:center width:45\n  bar:Actionnaires from:01/07/1991 till:01/01/1996 color:orange text:\"Hutchison Whampoa\" align:center width:45\n  bar:Actionnaires from:01/01/1996 till:01/09/1999 color:redorange text:\"Hutchison Whampoa ~and ~British Aerospace\" align:center width:45\n  bar:Actionnaires from:01/09/1999 till:01/11/1999 color:orange text:\"~Mannesmann AG\" align:center width:45\n  bar:Actionnaires from:01/11/1999 till:01/08/2000 color:redorange text:\"Vodafone\" align:center width:45\n  bar:Actionnaires from:01/08/2000 till:end color:orange text:\"France Télécom\" align:center width:45\n  bar:Faits from:13/02/2001 till:13/02/2001 color:black text:\"French stock exchange introdution\" width:50 fontsize:M \n  bar:Faits from:01/06/2001 till:01/06/2001 color:black text:\"~ ~Itinéris, Ola and ~Mobicarte become Orange\" width:50 fontsize:M\n  bar:Faits from:01/06/2006 till:01/06/2006 color:black text:\"Wanadoo becomes Orange\" width:50 fontsize:M \n  bar:Faits from:21/11/2003 till:21/11/2003 color:black text:\"~Exits Paris Stock Exchange\"  width:50 fontsize:M \n  bar:Faits from:01/11/2008 till:01/11/2008 color:black text:\"~Orange Cinéma Séries ~and Orange Sport ~launch\"  width:50 fontsize:M\n\n</timeline>\n\nIn July 1991, [[Hutchison Telecom]], a UK subsidiary of the [[Hong Kong]]-based conglomerate [[Hutchison Whampoa]], acquired a controlling stake in [[Microtel Communications Ltd]], who by then had acquired a licence to develop a mobile network in the United Kingdom.<ref name=OBS-H-04/><ref name=OBS-H-35/><ref name=\"Hutchinson actionnaire majoritaire microtel\"/> Hutchison renamed Microtel to Orange Personal Communications Services Ltd, and on 28 April 1994 the Orange brand was launched in the UK mobile phone market.

Consequently, this led to the disappearance of a number of brands.\n\nFrom 1 June 2006, France Télécom tried to commercialize all its products under a single worldwide brand, becoming the sole brand of the France Telecom group for Internet, television and mobile services in the majority of countries in which Orange operated.

            "text": "Orange S.A. (French pronunciation: [ɔʁɑ̃ʒ ɛs ɑ]), formerly France Télécom S.A. (stylized as france telecom) is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. It has 266 million customers worldwide and employs 89,000 people in France, and 59,000 elsewhere. In 2015, the group had a revenue of €40 billion. The company's head office is located in Issy-les-Moulineaux. Orange has been the company's main brand for mobile, landline, internet and Internet Protocol television (IPTV) services since 2006. The Orange brand originated in the United Kingdom in 1994 after Hutchison Whampoa acquired a controlling stake in Microtel Communications: that company became a subsidiary of Mannesmann in 1999 and then was acquired by France Télécom in 2000. The France Télécom company was rebranded to Orange on 1 July 2013. The company has faced criticism due to the Orange S.A. suicides. In 1792, under the French Revolution, the first communication network was developed to enable the rapid transmission of information in a warring and unsafe country. That was the optical telegraphy network of Claude Chappe. In 1878, after the invention of the electrical telegraph and then the invention of the telephone, the French State created a Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. Telephone Services were added to the ministry when they were nationalised in 1889. However, it was not until 1923 that the second 'T' (for 'telephones') appeared and the department of P&T became PTT. In 1941, a General Direction of Telecommunications was created within this ministry. Then, in 1944, the National Centre of Telecommunications Studies (CNET) was created to develop the telecommunications industry in France.[citation needed] In the 1970s, France attempted to make up for its delay in developing communications infrastructure, compared to other countries, by launching the programme \"Delta LP\" (increasing the main lines).[citation needed] It was at that time that the majority of the local loop was built (that is all the cables linking the users to the operator). Moreover, with the help of French manufacturers, digital switching -- Minitel and the GSM standard -- were invented by engineers and CNET researchers. In 1982, Telecom introduced Minitel online ordering for its customers. Until 1988, France Télécom was known as the direction générale des Télécommunications, a division of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. It became autonomous in 1990. This was in response to a European directive, aimed at making competition mandatory in public services from 1 January 1998. The 2 July 1990 Bill changed France Télécom into an operator of public law, with Marcel Roulet the first Chairman. Since then, the company has had a separate body corporate from the State and acquired financial autonomy. It was privatised by Lionel Jospin's Plural Left government starting on 1 January 1998. The French government, both directly and through its holding company ERAP, continues to hold a stake of almost 27% in the company. In addition, the government Conseil of Ministers names the CEO. In September 1995, Michel Bon was appointed to run France Télécom Group. In 1997, the capital of the new public company was successfully floated whereas the dot-com bubble phenomenon made the stock exchanges bullish. A second share offering occurred in 1998. France Télécom got behind in the internationalization launched by its international competitors such as Vodafone, thus, it started looking for targets at the highest speculation rate of the dot-com bubble. Moreover, its alliance with Deutsche Telekom based on a reciprocal capital contribution of 2% broke off when Deutsche Telekom announced that they were planning to do business with Telecom Italia without letting the French know; even if this project ended up failing. In July 1991, Hutchison Telecom, a UK subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, acquired a controlling stake in Microtel Communications Ltd, who by then had acquired a licence to develop a mobile network in the United Kingdom. Hutchison renamed Microtel to Orange Personal Communications Services Ltd, and on 28 April 1994 the Orange brand was launched in the UK mobile phone market. A holding company structure was adopted in 1995 with the establishment of Orange plc. In April 1996, Orange went public and floated on the London Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, majority-owned by Hutchison (48.22%), followed by BAe (21.1%). In June 1996, it became the youngest company to enter the FTSE 100, valued at £2.4 billion. In October 1999, the German conglomerate Mannesmann AG acquired Orange for a price equivalent to €7,900 per customer, i.e. US$33bn. Mannesmann's acquisition of Orange triggered Vodafone to make a hostile takeover bid for Mannesmann. Shortly thereafter, in February 2000, Vodafone acquired Mannesmann for US$183 billion, and decided to divest Orange because EU regulations would not allow it to hold two mobile licences. In August 2000, France Télécom bought Orange plc from Vodafone for a total estimated cost of €39.7 bn. At the time, France Télécom also bought stakes in several other international firms (GlobalOne, Equant, Internet Telecom, Freeserve, EresMas, NTL and Mobilcom), of which some have since been sold back. Through this process, France Télécom became the fourth biggest global operator. The mobile telephone operations of Orange plc were merged with the majority of the mobile operations of France Télécom, forming the new group Orange S.A. On 13 February 2001, Orange S.A. was listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange with an initial public offering of 95 Euros per share, with a secondary listing in London. In May 2001, Orange S.A. was listed on the CAC 40, the benchmark stock market index of the top 40 French companies in terms of market capitalisation. In June 2001, the France Telecom Mobile brands Itinéris, OLA, and Mobicarte were replaced by the Orange brand. On 21 November 2003, France Telecom withdrew the 13.7% of Orange's shares traded on the Paris stock exchange. On 2 October 2002, the CEO, Thierry Breton was given the task of turning the company around after the company became crippled by debt following the drop of the company's stock price. On 30 September 2002, the company's stock price was €6.94, down from €219 on 2 March 2000. France Télécom was the second most indebted company worldwide in terms of short-term liabilities. The company obtained 15bn of debt adjustment that needed to be borne by banks and investors, another 15bn as a capital increase from the French State since it was still the majority shareholder, and an additional 15bn in cash from internal savings. On 25 February 2005, Thierry Breton was appointed Minister of Finance and Industry and Didier Lombard, who had been head of the firm's new technologies division, replaced him as CEO. The NeXT scheme was the recovery plan for France Télécom which aimed at, among other things, reducing costs, especially wage costs, carrying on a converging policy for its products and services, and grouping together all the brands under a single brand, except for the activities dealing with fixed-line telephone which would stay under the designation 'France Télécom'. Consequently, this led to the disappearance of a number of brands. From 1 June 2006, France Télécom tried to commercialize all its products under a single worldwide brand, becoming the sole brand of the France Telecom group for Internet, television and mobile services in the majority of countries in which Orange operated. Orange Business Services became the brand for all its business services offerings worldwide, replacing the Equant brand. In June 2007, Orange and Mid Europa Partners acquired Austrian mobile network company One, re-branding it as Orange Austria. In 2012, it was sold to Hutchison 3G and the Orange Austria brand was terminated. In November 2008, Orange launched five Orange Cinema Series channels. To do so, Orange bought the exclusive rights from Warner Bros. for first runs of all new films, previously held by TPS Star (a subsidiary of the Canal+ Group), as well as all films in its catalogue and rights to the film catalogues of Gaumont, HBO and MGM. Orange also secured exclusive rights to broadcast Saturday evening Ligue 1 football matches from the French Football Federation. Free accused Orange of tied-selling as the Orange channels were only available to its subscribers. In June 2008, the firm abandoned a €27 billion bid for Swedish operator TeliaSonera after the two companies failed to agree terms. In 2008, Orange was given permission from Apple to sell the iPhone in Austria, Belgium, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Jordan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Switzerland and Orange's African markets. On 8 September 2009, Orange and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom announced they were in advanced talks to merge their UK operations to create the largest mobile operator with 37% of the market.

In mid-April 2010, Orange UK announced that it would outsource the management of its broadband network to BT. This announcement was greeted positively by broadband commentators, who felt that the move was likely to improve Orange's broadband quality and customer services. On 2 March 2012, Didier Lombard, who remained special advisor to Stéphane Richard, left the company. His departure was shadowed by controversy over his stock options: he was suspected of having stayed with the company longer to wait for the France Telecom share to recover and then exercise his stock option. The share was trading at around €16, whereas his stock options were at €23. On 3 February 2012, Hutchison Whampoa announced that it would buy Orange Austria for US$1.7 billion.

As part of this agreement, the Romanian government would own a 20% stake in the new entity, and Orange would take over fixed operations. The MCSI had first entered talks to sell Telekom Romania in September 2019, when Deutsche Telekom announced that it was prepared to sell its stake in Telekom Romania to Orange. In June 2021, Orange partners with Sanofi, Capgemini and Generali to launch Future4care. This all-European start-up accelerator will help develop upcoming companies focused on digital health. Between the beginning of January 2008 and April 2011, more than 60 France Télécom employees died by suicide, (in 2008 and the early part of 2009 there were 25 ) some leaving notes blaming stress and misery at work. In October 2009, the wave of suicides led former Deputy CEO Louis-Pierre Wenes to resign under trade union pressure, to be replaced by Stéphane Richard. Faced with multiple suicides of employees, the company promoted Stéphane Richard to the chief executive officer on 1 February 2010, while Didier Lombard remained as chairman. The suicide rate among France Télécom's 102,000 domestic employees was 15.3 per year in that year, compared with an average of 14.7 suicides per 100,000 in the overall French population. Following an investigation, the Inspection du travail (Labour Inspection) told the labour union Sud-PTT that the work organisation at France Télécom \"was conducive to generating suffering at work\" and \"health risks\" for employees. An investigation was conducted by the audit firm Technologia at the request of France Télécom's management. Of the 102,843 employees in the group's parent company, 80,080 responded, i.e. a response rate of 77.9%. The fact-finding report revealed a \"very poor general feeling\", \"strained physical and mental health\", and a \"tense and even violent working environment\" for some categories of personnel. Working conditions were deemed difficult, mainly for personnel in charge of sales and customer interventions. Given heavy media coverage, these findings were the source of major contention about working conditions. On 20 December 2019, former CEO Didier Lombard and Orange were found guilty of moral harassment towards their employees. In 2011, following complaints by Internet users, Megaupload accused Orange of not providing sufficient connectivity to its site, thus severely limiting throughput from France, an allegation Orange denied. In November 2009, three users lodged a complaint against Orange for false advertising concerning its \"Unlimited 3G Key\" service. These customers criticised the operator for the misleading way in which this service is presented, since it isn't in fact unlimited. While it is true that there is no time limit, the user cannot download more than 1 gigabyte per month, thus limiting browsing. Unaware of this, the three plaintiffs browsed beyond plan limits and had to pay additional fees as a result. In March 2011, the information website OWNI uncovered a questionable financial deal that enabled the Orange group to acquire a 3G license. On 28 July 2011, the Competition Authority fined France Télécom €27.6 million for having improperly impeded the development of new competing operators in the French overseas departments (primarily Réunion). France Télécom used its dominant position, resulting in particular from its former monopoly, to take unfair advantage of its competitors. The practices identified by the Authority were: excessive rate levels as operators of the quasi-totality of the telecommunication infrastructure local loops, making use of the data which they have access to, France Télécom has targeted former subscribers who had switched to a competitor, in order to win them back, offering them specific deals. margin squeeze on broadband Internet offers maintaining call barring services inconsistent with the prior selection of an alternative operator On 1 January 2011, Orange users' SMS and MMS were sent and billed multiple times. The operator agreed to reimburse the excess costs to consumers, explaining that the error came from a \"third party operator\" (which turned out to be Bouygues Telecom), said not to have sent acknowledgements, which caused the messages to be resent. A computer problem at the Bouygues platform was blamed. During the night of 31 December 2010 to 1 January 2011, more than 930 million text messages were exchanged in France (for the three operators combined), setting a new record compared with the peaks of the previous years. On 21 March 2007 Watchdog, a television series by the BBC focusing on consumer protection, published the results from a broadband survey they held. According to the survey Orange is the worst ISP in the UK. 68% of Orange customers that took part in the survey said they were unsatisfied with Orange's customer service, it was voted as the most unreliable broadband provider, and it had the highest number of dissatisfied customers. Two thirds of Orange customers experienced problems cancelling their Orange broadband. In response to the problems with Orange UK broadband and 3G broadband during March 2009 and April 2009 the 3G data network has been upgraded to 3.5G and increased signal coverage. This new network can be seen in action on many mobile phones which display network for instance the Nokia N95, when the phone detects the higher speed. The Orange UK mobile broadband USB adapter works with the new network. The 3G networks for all telecommunication suppliers still struggle to get the throughput that was originally advertised when these networks were announced. The UK Telecoms Regulator has reported on the challenges for all suppliers. A consumer organisation forum web site known as OrangeProblems.co.uk focuses on the poor level of service provided by Orange Broadband in the UK. Initially set up as WanadooProblems.co.uk, the site focuses on the infamous Orange local loop unbundling and poor customer service but covers a wider range of Orange operations such as lost email, significantly delayed SMTP and outages, suspicions of eavesdropping, et al. Orange Mobile has been criticised during a Channel 4 News investigation for a lack of security which potentially exposed customer records to fraud. In August 2007 Orange was criticised for summarily deleting email accounts tied to old Freeserve and Wanadoo 'pay as you go' dial-up accounts with no warning. In August 2008, after well publicised problems with iPhone 3G performances, customers compared their download speed and discovered that Orange in France was capping 3G download bandwidth. Orange admitted capping to 384kbit/s, well below the theoretical 7.2Mbit/s provided by the iPhone. Orange uncapped 3G and 3G+ by mid-September 2008. The French chairman and CEO of the Orange telecommunications company, Stéphane Richard said in Cairo regarding his company operations in Israel, \"Believe me, I would cancel the contract tomorrow if I could. We want to end this and to fix this; we don't want it.\" Later, Orange announced its desire to discontinue use of its popular brand name by its Israeli operator Partner Communications Company. The president of the State of Israel Reuven Rivlin said in response \"Just yesterday Israel faced attacks from anti-Israel and anti-Semitic bodies, who have chosen to delegitimize the state of Israel, and to launch rockets at us from the Gaza Strip. We must face these challenges together, right and left,\" Rivlin said. Israeli culture minister Miri Regev said, \"I call on Jews of France and the world to disconnect from Orange unless Stéphane Richard takes back his words. The time has come for them to understand that Jews in the world and sane voices that oppose anti-Semitism and racism also have power.\" The statement on the company's website announced in response that \"The Orange Group is a telecoms operator and as such its primary concern is to defend and promote the value of its brand in markets in which it is present,\" the statement began. \"The Group does not engage in any kind of political debate under any circumstance.\" Later, Richard visited Israel to clarify his remarks. He met Israeli PM Benyamin Netanyahu and former president, Shimon Peres. Richard told both Netanyahu and Peres that Orange has not and will not support anti-Israel boycott efforts, and insisted that its announced decision to abrogate its relationship with Partner was purely commercial and not political. On 30 June 2015, Orange and Partner announced a change to their 10-year licensing agreement. Orange paid Partner €40 million to add an opt out clause to the contract, with which Partner conducted a market survey which is determine the best course of action moving forward. In the first year only Partner can opt out, with either party being able to opt out in the second year. Regardless of which party opts to exercise the out clause, Orange will pay Partner an additional €50 million to end the arrangement. Orange stated that the money paid to Partner was purely for re-branding purposes and affirmed their previous statement that their wish to leave Israel is based on desire to discontinue license agreements and maintain only subsidiaries that they control, rather than a boycott. Orange would make the relevant payments over the course of two years and charge it to their books as a mix of marketing, sales, customer services and related expenses. As part of the agreement Orange's research and development activities within Israel would transition to the Orange name, but would be restricted from entering the telecommunications services market. In September 2015, Orange reaffirmed their commitment to Israel with an investment in Hola, a video distribution network. In February 2016, Orange and Partner decided to terminate their agreement. As a result, rebranding has resulted in Orange Israel becoming part of Partner. Governance of the Orange group is centred in its board of directors, executive committee and three committees that steer Orange's strategy: Audit Committee: Created in 1997, the Audit Committee comprises three members appointed for indefinite terms by the board of directors on the recommendation of the Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee.
