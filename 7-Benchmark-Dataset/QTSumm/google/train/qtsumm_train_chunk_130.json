In 2015, Clarke faced England's Michael Wild in the final match of the championship. Despite giving a tough competition, Clarke lost to Wild with a final score of 4-7, making him the runner-up in the championship.  The following year, in 2016, Clarke had another chance to compete in the finals of the European Snooker Championship. This time, he was up against fellow Welsh player, Jak Jones. Unfortunately, history repeated itself, and Clarke lost the final with the same score as the previous year - 4-7 - making him the runner-up once again.",
