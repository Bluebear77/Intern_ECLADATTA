Furthermore, they had the highest attendance of 21409 people. This indicates that they have strong support from their local fan base which could have been a major factor in their success throughout the season. Additionally, their final score against Sacramento Surge was 45-21, which was much higher than any other opponent's score in this table. These factors combined make it likely that London Monarchs were going to take home the championship title for this season.",
