For Usain Bolt, the \"SB\" abbreviation stands for a season's best, which means that his time of 9.79 seconds was his best performance in that particular season. In contrast, the \"PB\" abbreviation for Andre De Grasse represents a personal best, signifying that his time of 9.92 seconds was the best time he had ever achieved in his career up to that point. The absence of any notation in the 'Notes' column for the other runners implies that their respective times were neither a season's best nor a personal best, but it still showcases their performance in the race.",
