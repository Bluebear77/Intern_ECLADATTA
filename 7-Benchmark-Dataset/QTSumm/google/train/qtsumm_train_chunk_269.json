Europe has one large artificial island, the Flevopolder in the Netherlands, while South America has Fund\u00e3o Island in Brazil. This distribution suggests that Asian countries have embraced land reclamation more aggressively, likely due to a combination of growing populations, limited space, and advancements in technology.",
