Conway, Joanna Kerns, and John Landis each direct 1 episode. From this data, not clear pattern in director choice affect how many people watch. While pilot episode directed by Michael Engler have most people watch at 6.06 million, other episodes with different directors, like \"Weekend Warriors\" by John Fortenberry and \"9 Lives\" by Matt Shakman, also have many people watch with 4.76 and 4.72 million.

        "summary": "Analyzing the table of Johnny Herbert's 24 Hours of Le Mans results, several patterns emerge in relation to his co-drivers and the associated team countries. Firstly, it is evident that Herbert has often partnered with Germany's Volker Weidler and Belgium's Bertrand Gachot, as they were his co-drivers for three consecutive years (1990-1992). These years, Herbert raced for the Japan Mazdaspeed team. Interestingly, the team country seemed to change almost every year, with Herbert competing for teams from Japan, United States, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom throughout his career. Another pattern is that Herbert's co-drivers predominantly came from European countries, emphasizing his consistent collaboration with European drivers in the prestigious race event.",
