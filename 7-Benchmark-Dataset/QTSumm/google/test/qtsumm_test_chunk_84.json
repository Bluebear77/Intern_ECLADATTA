        "summary": "There seems to be a recurring presence of athletes from certain sports as flag bearers for Belgium at the Olympics. Athletics appears to be the most frequently represented sport, with notable athletes like Gaston Roelants being the flag bearer multiple times during the 1960s and early 1970s, and Olivia Borl\u00e9e and Tia Hellebaut in more recent years. Bobsleigh is also a sport with repeated representation, such as Max Houben and Hanna Mari\u00ebn carrying the flag in different years. However, the chosen sport does not remain consistent over time and shows variation, with sports like snowboarding, table tennis, and sailing also represented as flag bearers throughout the years.",
