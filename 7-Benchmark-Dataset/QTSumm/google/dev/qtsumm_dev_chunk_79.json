At first, there was increase in attendance, as it went from 8,073 in 1990 to 11,548 in 1992 and peaked at 19,500 in 1993. But, after 1993 match, audience attendance started to go down, dropping to 10,846 in 1995 and reaching its lowest point of 2,000 in 1996 during game between New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Despite this, attendance rose again to 12,000 for 1996 New Zealand vs Great Britain match, suggest that factors like match importance or the competing teams may have effect on number of attendees.",
