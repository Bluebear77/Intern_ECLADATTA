He first served as the Leader of Opposition between 1981 and 1985 as a member of the NDP party. After a break during which Willard Phelps, Daniel Lang, and later Tony's own second tenure as an NDP leader held the same position, he then served a second term as the Leader of Opposition from 1992 to 1995. This break in his terms followed by a return to the same position with the same party is an uncommon occurrence in political careers.",

Maybe at first many people want to see the new show, but then some people not like the show's story or how they tell, so they stop watching. Other reason may be some episodes are more interesting so people like to watch and tell friends to watch. Also, outside things like having other show or event at same time, or holiday time, can make people not watch and make number change in the season.",
