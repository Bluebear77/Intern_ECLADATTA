<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Chronology">Chronology</span></h2>
<p>In early 1995, executives of London Mall, a British software developer conceived the idea of an Internet lottery. A license to run a fixed <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds" title="Odds">odds</a> Internet lottery, without international marketing restrictions, was obtained from the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a> government. The International Lottery in Liechtenstein Foundation (ILLF), a charitable foundation, was formed to operate this lottery, then called Interlotto, and it quickly established its position as a leading e-commerce site in Europe. The International Lottery in Liechtenstein Foundation (ILLF) also introduced the first instant <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratchcard" title="Scratchcard">scratchcard</a> games on the Internet during this time.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The first Interlotto ticket was sold to <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Frick_(politician)" title="Mario Frick (politician)">Mario Frick</a>, the Prime Minister of Liechtenstein (December 15, 1993 - April 5, 2001). The first Interlotto draw took place at the Köfferli bar in the quaint capital of Vaduz, Liechtenstein on the Saturday evening of 7 October 1995. Caroline Burdet <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.lotto.li/skeleton/gallery.html">[1]</a>, Liechtenstein's first Olympic <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobsledder" title="Bobsledder" class="mw-redirect">bobsledder</a>, drew the winning six numbers for what is billed as the first nationally sanctioned lottery on the Internet.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Fourteen months later, on 13 January 1997 the lottery site was renamed from Interlotto to PLUS Lotto following an agreement with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), one of the world's best known and most respected humanitarian organisations, whereby the IFRC would become its major <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficiary" title="Beneficiary">beneficiary</a>.

<p>The ILLF offered two weekly lotteries and one monthly lottery.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Weekly_6.2F49_Lottery">Weekly 6/49 Lottery</span></h4>
<p>In every lotto draw, six numbers plus one bonus number were drawn from a range of balls numbered 1 to 49. Players choose six different numbers plus a bonus number by a method of their own choosing. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prizes" title="Prizes" class="mw-redirect">Prizes</a> were awarded for matching two, three, four, five or six numbers as well as five plus the bonus ball and six plus the bonus ball. 55545789</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Draw">Draw</span></h4>
<p>The 6/49 lottery draw was conducted every Friday at the ILLF's studio in Liechtenstein and is scrutinized by an auditor from Thöny Treuhand AG, Vaduz. Draws were performed using one of two mechanical ball machines manufactured by Editec (France). Prior to the draw a ball set was selected at random and test draws were carried out to ensure that the machine and ball sets have not been tampered with. After the draw an independent program is run by the auditor and the results compared to the database to verify that the data is correct and there are no errors. The draw was filmed and then made available via the Internet.</p>
<p>The Prize Pool for the 6/49 lottery draw was 90% of the value of the ticket price. The allocation is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>2% for a 6 number match, plus bonus ball</li>
<li>8% for a 6 number match</li>
<li>10% for promotional incentive prizes</li>
<li>on average 2% for a 5 number match, plus bonus ball</li>
<li>on average 4% for a 5 number match</li>
<li>on average 7% for a 4 number match</li>
