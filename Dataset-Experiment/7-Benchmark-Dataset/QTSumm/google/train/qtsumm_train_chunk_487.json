LP start first with Sylvain Van de Weyer in 1831, and after parties keep changing during century, with both having many times in power. LP is in power more in early to middle 1800s, but later half of century, PC is in power more for long times, with important people like Adolphe Dechamps and Guillaume d'Aspremont Lynden. This change between parties shows balance of power and influence between LP and PC in Belgium in 1800s.",
