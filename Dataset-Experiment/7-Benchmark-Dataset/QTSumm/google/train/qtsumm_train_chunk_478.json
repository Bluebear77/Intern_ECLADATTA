        "summary": "The line of succession among the House of Lambakanna I predominantly followed a patrilineal pattern, whereby the throne was passed down from father to son or to younger brothers. This pattern can be observed through the reigns of Vasabha, Vankanasika Tissa, Gajabahu I, Mahallaka Naga, Bhatika Tissa, and Kanittha Tissa. Additionally, some kings like Upatissa I and Mahanama gained the throne as a result of being the brothers or sons of their predecessors. However, exceptions to this pattern occurred in instances like Gothabhaya, who became king through his role as a Minister of State, and Chattagahaka Jantu, who gained the throne through marriage to Sangha, the daughter of Mahanama by his Sinhala Queen.",
