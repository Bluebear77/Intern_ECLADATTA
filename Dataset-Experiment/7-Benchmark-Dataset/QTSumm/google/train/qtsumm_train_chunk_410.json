On the other hand, the oldest song from 1935, \"Silent Night\" by Bing Crosby, boasts a similarly impressive sales record of 30 million copies. This indicates that despite a significant age gap of over 60 years, the sales difference between the two songs is relatively small, with Elton John's double-sided single selling only 3 million more than Bing Crosby's classic holiday tune. Thus, both songs have enjoyed immense popularity and commercial success across different eras in music history.",
