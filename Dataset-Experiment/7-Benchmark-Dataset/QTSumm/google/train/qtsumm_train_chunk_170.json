He change from 125cc class race on Derbi/Aprilia motorcycles to Moto2 class race on Suter bikes. Before the change, Terol has very good result in the 125cc class, from 2008 and later, he always improve his position, have many victory and get more points, finally won the championship in 2011. But after entering Moto2 class in 2012, his performance has big change. Terol has less win, less top 3 and less pole positions, also get much less point and his championship position is worse. This change may be because Terol cannot adapt well to the more strong and hard Moto2 machine, make his performance level go down much.",
