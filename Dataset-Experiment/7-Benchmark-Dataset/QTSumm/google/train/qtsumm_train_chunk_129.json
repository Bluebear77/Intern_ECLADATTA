However, the party's influence rose significantly during her time in leadership, with their vote percentage reaching 56.7% and securing 15 seats in the 1985 elections.   On the other hand, Charles Savarin's leadership saw a decline in the party's popularity. The percentage of votes dropped drastically to 13.6% in 2000 and continued to decrease in subsequent elections, eventually resulting in the party losing all of its seats and becoming an extra-parliamentary force in 2005 and 2009.",
