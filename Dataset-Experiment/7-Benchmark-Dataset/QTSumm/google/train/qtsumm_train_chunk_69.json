In terms of directors, there seems to be no significant pattern of reoccurring collaborations, although he has worked with Sathyan Anthikad twice for \"Kadha Thudarunnu\" and \"Snehaveedu.\" The variety in Prem's co-stars and directors suggests that he has had the opportunity to work in a range of film projects, rather than being confined to a specific niche within the industry.",
