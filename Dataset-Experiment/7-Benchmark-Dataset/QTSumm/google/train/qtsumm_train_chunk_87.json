In the India vs West Indies match in 2006, the game ended in a draw with multiple centuries scored by both teams, including Dravid, Sehwag, and Kaif from India and Lara from West Indies. However, a decade later, in the 2016 match between the same teams, India emerged victorious with centuries from players like Ashwin and Saha, highlighting an evolution in the competitiveness and result-oriented nature of Test cricket at this venue, further evidenced by England's win over West Indies in 2019 with centuries from Root and Chase.",
