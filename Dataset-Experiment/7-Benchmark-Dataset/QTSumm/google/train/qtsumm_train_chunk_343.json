In the early editions, mottos focused on unity and lasting peace, with the 1st and 2nd festivals reiterating the need for youth to unite for lasting peace, democracy, and national independence. As time progressed, mottos shifted to emphasize opposition to nuclear weapons, aggressive imperialist pacts, and promoting peaceful coexistence. In more recent editions, the focus appears to be anti-imperialism, peace, solidarity, social transformation, and global struggle against imperialism and war, suggesting that the event aims to address pressing global issues and foster unity among young people who share the same goals and values.",

        "query": "Which network had better ratings and why\uff1f",
        "summary": "It appears that NBC had better ratings than CBS. From the table, we can see that the average viewership for seasons 1-5 on NBC was 11.86 million viewers per season, compared to 7.13 million viewers per season for seasons 6-7 on CBS. This suggests that NBC had more successful ratings than CBS did for Medium. It is possible that this could have been due to a combination of factors such as the time slot, episode count, and content of the show itself.",
