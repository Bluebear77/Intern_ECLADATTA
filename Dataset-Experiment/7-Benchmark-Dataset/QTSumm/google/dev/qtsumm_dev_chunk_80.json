This was likely due to the episode focusing on Stanley Lucerne. Additionally, the episode was written by Jamie Brittain and Mark Hammer, who had not been involved in writing any of the preceding episodes. This lack of familiarity and connection with the series may have caused the episode to be the least popular.",

Performance-wise, his best years were undoubtedly in 1981, 1983, and 1986. Although he did not win the race during any of these years, he achieved 4th, 5th, and 2nd place finishes respectively. 1986 was particularly exceptional for him, achieving his only front-row start in his Indy 500 career, and narrowly missing out on victory. Furthermore, one can see how crucial the combination of the chassis and engine was for Cogan's overall performance. ",
