The season began with a relatively high viewership of 5.52 million for the first episode, followed by a steady decline until the fifth episode, which brought in 4.88 million viewers. However, there was a small but noteworthy spike in viewership for episode 9 which garnered 5.19 million viewers. Despite a steady performance following episode 9, viewership dipped significantly in episode 15, which recorded 3.71 million viewers. The final episode marked another substantial increase in viewership as 5.46 million viewers tuned in, suggesting that the viewership trend for this season experienced a few peaks and valleys with no consistent pattern.",
