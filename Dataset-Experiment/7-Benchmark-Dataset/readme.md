This directory contains the study of 7 Benchmark Dataset.

Gain comprehensive understanding of existing benchmark datasets, focusing on their interrelations.

7 Datasets are introduced in QTSumm and LLM-T2T:

1.ToTTo, https://github.com/google-research-datasets/ToTTo

2.LOGICNLG, https://github.com/wenhuchen/LogicNLG/blob/master/all_csv.zip

3.QTSumm (based on LOGICNLG and ToTTo), https://huggingface.co/datasets/yale-nlp/QTSumm

4.LOTNLG (based on LOGICNLG), https://github.com/yale-nlp/LLM-T2T/tree/main/data

5.FetaQA (based on ToTTo), https://github.com/Yale-LILY/FeTaQA/tree/main/data

6.WTQ, https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikitablequestions and https://github.com/ppasupat/WikiTableQuestions/tree/master/csv

7.F2WTQ (based on WTQ), https://github.com/yale-nlp/LLM-T2T/tree/main/data

- QTSumm is created on the basis of LOGICNLG and ToTTo and implement fact template to generate Query-Focused Summarization over Tabular Data.

- [LOGICNLG, LOTNLG, FetaQA, F2WTQ] are used to train multiple LLMs.
