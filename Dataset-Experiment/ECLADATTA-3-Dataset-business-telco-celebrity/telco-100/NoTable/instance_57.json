Before the network in Japan, [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]] built the first cellular network around [[Chicago]] in 1977 and trialled it in 1978.{{sfn|Shi|2007|p=60}}\n\nAs in the pre-cellular era, the [[Nordic countries]] were among the pioneers in wireless technologies. These countries together designed the [[Nordic Mobile Telephone|NMT]] standard which first launched in Sweden in 1981.{{sfn|Shi|2007|p=61}} NMT was the first mobile phone network to feature international [[roaming]]. In 1983, the first 1G cellular network launched in the United States, which was Chicago-based [[Ameritech]] using the [[Motorola DynaTAC]] mobile phone.\n\nIn the early to mid 1990s, 1G was superseded by newer 2G (second generation) cellular technologies such as [[GSM]] and [[cdmaOne]]. Although 1G also used digital signaling to connect the radio towers (which listen to the handsets) to the rest of the telephone system, the voice itself during a call is encoded to digital signals in 2G whereas 1G uses analog FM modulation for the voice transmission, much like a 2-way [[land mobile radio system|land mobile radio]].  Most 1G networks had been discontinued by the early 2000s. Some regions especially Eastern Europe continued running these networks for much longer. The last operating 1G network was closed down in Russia in 2017."
