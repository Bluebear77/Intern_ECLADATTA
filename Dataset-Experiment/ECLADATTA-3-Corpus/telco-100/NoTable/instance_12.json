It is one of the three bodies officially recognized by the [[European Union]] as a [[European Standards Organization]] (ESO), the others being [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] and [[CENELEC]]. The role of the ESOs is to support EU regulation and policies through the production of harmonised [[European Standards]] (ENs) and other deliverables. The standards developed by ESOs are the only ones that can be recognized as ENs.\n\nETSI develops standards in key global technologies such as: [[GSM]]™, [[TETRA]], [[3G]], [[4G]], [[5G]], [[DECT]]™.\n\nETSI’s standardization activities are organized around sectors: Home & Office, Better Living with ICT, Content Delivery, Networks, [[Wireless|Wireless Systems]], Transportation, Connecting Things, Interoperability, Public Safety and Security. Technical activities are carried out in the different ETSI technical groups (Technical Committee (TC), ETSI Project (EP), ETSI Partnership Project (EPP), Industry Specification Group (ISG), and Special Committee (SC).\n\nThe organisation is located in [[Sophia-Antipolis]], in the south of [[France]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mobile Competence Centre |url=https://www.3gpp.org/about-us/mobile-competence-centre |access-date=2023-10-03 |website=3GPP |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2023, ETSI reported a data breach.
