The company, a [[subsidiary]] of [[Todd McFarlane Productions, Inc.]], is headquartered in [[Tempe, Arizona]].<ref>[https://www.quidditch.org.au/m-office/mcfarlane-toys-headquarters.html Mcfarlane Toys Headquarters] on Quiddith.org</ref>\n\nAs of 2021, McFarlane featured products with licenses of games and companies such as [[DC Comics]], ''[[Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba]]'', ''[[Warhammer (game)|Warhammer]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'', [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', and ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''.\n\n==Overview==\nIn 1994, Todd McFarlane was working with [[Mattel]] to produce action figures based on his comic book characters. When the two could not decide on how to make the toys to McFarlane's satisfaction, he reclaimed the toy rights to his characters and started his own toy company.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\nOriginally dubbed \"Todd Toys\", the name was changed in 1995 following pressure from Mattel, who feared that the new company's name would be confused with that of [[Barbie|Barbie's]] younger brother.<ref name=\"Scott2010\">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Sharon M.|title=Toys and American Culture: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbTUorcuXkoC&pg=PA201|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35111-2|pages=58, 201–203}}</ref>\n\nProduction began with action figures based upon Todd McFarlane's ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'' comic series and has since grown to feature a large number of licensed property lines including ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and \"Movie Maniacs\" (which features numerous famous horror icons such as [[Freddy Krueger]], [[Jason Voorhees]], [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], [[The Terminator]], [[Leatherface]], and [[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]), as well as other characters and lines like basketball, hockey and baseball legends, along with [[Character (arts)|characters from video games]] such as ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]'', ''[[Onimusha]]'', and ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]''. Other media such as story book characters from ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'' have been represented.<ref>{{cite news|date=December 1, 2000|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68743264.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921200640/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68743264.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 21, 2014|title=McFarlane Toys|newspaper=Playthings }}</ref>\n\nThe company has produced original works, giving a grotesque twist to [[fairy tale]] stories such as ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', and historical figures. McFarlane has collaborated with artists like [[Clive Barker]] (on [[Tortured Souls]]) and [[H. R. Giger]] to produce other original figures.<ref name=\"Scott2010\"/>\n\n==Spawn figures==\nThe first line of ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'' toys ever produced was released in 1994 and consisted of six figures, the hero Spawn and his medieval counterpart (aptly named Medieval Spawn) with [[Tremor (comics)|Tremor]] and the villains [[Violator (comics)|Violator]], [[Overt-Kill]], and Clown, as well as a Spawn Alley Playset, the Spawnmobile and the Violator Monster Rig. They were notably different from the toys common on shelves at the time because of their level of detail in both sculpting and painting. Other toys utilized only a few colors painted in general areas (a single \"flesh tone\" for the face, etc.) and were tacked to cardboard backs. McFarlane's figures had individual items such as spikes, teeth, claws, and buttons painted individually and packaged encased by hard plastic which surrounded both the figure and blister card, making them more suitable collectors items. Each toy in the first line came with a regular-sized comic (although with fewer pages than the standard 22), which were individualized to the character.<ref name=\"Scott2010\"/>\n\nThe series would include alternate time periods and different takes on the classic characters with Series 10, 20<ref>{{cite news|title=Film, TV, Comic Characters Ready to Hit Store Shelves|location=Washington, DC|year=2001|last=Szadkowski|first=Joseph|newspaper=The Washington Times|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-71053594|quote=Spawn Series 20 looks back at classic characters in Mr. McFarlane's 8-year-old sequential-art universe and pays tribute to its most popular characters – Domina, Overtkill, Violator and Spawn}}{{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref> and 30<ref>{{cite news|title=Spawn at 30|date=October 1, 2006|last=Benitez|first=Tina|newspaper=Playthings|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-152748239.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921200653/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-152748239.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 21, 2014}}</ref> showing homage to the core characters of the books.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\nPrototypes for Series 35 were revealed in 2008 but the series was cancelled before its release.

Frank Baum]].<ref name=\"Scott2010\" />\n\nIn 2004, the third series, subtitled 6 Faces of Madness, used historical killers and madmen as its theme, generating vividly detailed figurines of the 5th-century conqueror [[Attila the Hun]], American \"Wild West\" gunslinger [[Billy the Kid]], the \"mad monk\" [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]], the British [[serial killer]] [[Jack the Ripper]], the Hungarian \"Blood Queen\" [[Elizabeth Báthory|Elizabeth Bathory]], and the real-life inspiration for [[Dracula]], [[Vlad III the Impaler|Vlad the Impaler]].<ref name=\"Scott2010\"/>\n\nThe fourth series featured Twisted Fairy Tales. The figures were of classic children’s stories, including Peter Pumpkin-Eater, [[Hansel and Gretel|Hansel & Gretel]], [[Little Miss Muffet]], [[Humpty Dumpty]], & [[Little Red Riding Hood|Red Riding Hood]], and incorporated many of the gory elements that consumers had come to expect from McFarlane, but with a sense of ironic humor.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\nSeries 5 featured McFarlane's Twisted Christmas. Like the previous series, the figures all are twisted variations of [[Christmas]], including a hunchback and obese [[Santa Claus]] who hides a lifeless skull under a [[gas mask]]-like headpiece and wears contraptions on his hands similar to the glove of [[Freddy Krueger]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Customer care; These entrepreneurs are giving the city's retail landscape an adventurous twist|date=August 25, 2008|last=Motihar|first=Jhilmil|newspaper=India Today |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17069032.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921200645/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17069032.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Movie Maniacs===\nIn 1998, McFarlane introduced the Movie Maniacs line of figures. Series One began as a line of horror and science fiction based figures that had been licensed from influential and financially successful [[horror film]]s such as ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' and ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\nThe second series of figures expanded the character base for the line into the realms of cult and [[Action film|action cinema]], with a figure based on the [[Crow (comics)#Eric Draven|title character]] of ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]''. Series three would further push the boundaries of character selection into fantasy, with ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', straight action with ''[[Shaft (2000 film)|Shaft]]'', and back into cult/sci-fi with ''[[Escape from L.A.]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\nThese conventions would continue, with character selections in future series frequently containing a mix of many, or even all of these various [[film genre]]s, much to the chagrin of a small section of fans and collectors who, incorrectly, saw the line as being meant to be horror specific.<ref name=\"Scott2010\"/>\n\n==Music figures==\nMcFarlane Toys did not solely limit itself to creating figures based on Todd McFarlane's creations. Rather it branched out into other forms of media, capitalizing on the popularity of famous rock musicians with the release of figures based on the rock legends [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] in 1997. The number of music figures produced by the company continued to grow in number, diversity, and quality in the following years as they acquired the action figure rights to famous properties such as [[the Beatles]], [[Rob Zombie]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Metallica]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Iron Maiden]]'s mascot [[Eddie (mascot)|Eddie]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=\"Scott2010\" />\n\n===KISS===\n{{main|KISS action figures}}\nIn 1997, action figures were part of an overall marketing deal between McFarlane Toys and the [[rock band]] [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], with both toys and comic books based on their album ''[[Psycho Circus]]''.<ref name=tempe/> Release of new KISS products from McFarlane continues to the present day.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\n===The Beatles===\nThe second musical property that McFarlane released was based on [[the Beatles]], featuring figures of [[Paul McCartney]], [[John Lennon]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Ringo Starr]] as they appeared in their 1968 [[animated film]] ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', as well as their appearance in the 1965 ABC cartoon show also titled ''[[The Beatles (TV series)|The Beatles]]''.<ref name=\"tempe\"/> Despite three figure series based on cartoon versions of the band (two incarnations of the ''Yellow Submarine'' figures in 1996 and 2004), no figures of the real-life band members have been created by McFarlane Toys.<ref name=\"Scott2010\"/>\n\n==Sports figures==\nMcFarlane Toys reflects Todd McFarlane's love of sports in its creations of popular figures from all five major North American sports ([[baseball]], [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], [[ice hockey|hockey]] and [[stock car racing]]). The company has official licensing rights to the major professional leagues of all of these sports, and began this line, officially known as '''McFarlane Sports Picks''', in 2001.<ref name=tempe/>\n\n==Television figures==\nIn January 2007, McFarlane Toys announced plans for a line of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' action figures.<ref name=\"Scott2010\"/> Other series figures have included ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]'' and ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]''.<ref name=variety>{{cite news|title=Go figure: losties turn up as toys|location=Hollywood, CA|date=May 23, 2006|last=Schneider|first=Michael|newspaper=Daily Variety|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-147055492.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921200636/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-147055492.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ghoulish 'Walking Dead,' Phantom Figures|location=Washington, DC|date=November 1, 2012|last=Szadkowski|first=Joseph|newspaper=The Washington Times|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-307075953}}{{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref> In 2015, McFarlane toys launched a line of construction sets based on HBO's popular ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' TV series,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://winteriscoming.net/2015/11/27/game-of-thrones-holiday-gifts-mcfarlane-construction-sets/|title=Game of Thrones Holiday Gifts: McFarlane Construction Sets|date=November 27, 2015}}</ref> followed by a line of 6\" action figures to be released in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.toyark.com/2018/10/02/mcfarlane-toys-gets-game-of-thrones-action-figure-license-318160|title=McFarlane Toys Gets Game of Thrones Action Figure License|date=October 2, 2018|website=The Toyark - News}}</ref> The company also produces action figures based on the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Stranger Things]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/toys/3483852/mcfarlane-shows-off-new-stranger-things-figures-including-punk-eleven/|title=McFarlane Shows Off New \"Stranger Things\" Figures Including Punk Eleven|first=John|last=Squires|date=February 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===The McKenzie Brothers===\nReleased in September 2000, the figures were based on the characters of ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' and ''[[Strange Brew]]'' fame, [[Bob and Doug McKenzie]].

            "text": "McFarlane Toys is an American company founded by comic book creator Todd McFarlane which makes highly detailed model action figures of characters from films, comics, popular music, video games and various sporting genres. The company, a subsidiary of Todd McFarlane Productions, Inc., is headquartered in Tempe, Arizona. As of 2021, McFarlane featured products with licenses of games and companies such as DC Comics, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Warhammer, Mortal Kombat, Disney, The Princess Bride, and Avatar: The Last Airbender. In 1994, Todd McFarlane was working with Mattel to produce action figures based on his comic book characters. When the two could not decide on how to make the toys to McFarlane's satisfaction, he reclaimed the toy rights to his characters and started his own toy company.[citation needed] Originally dubbed \"Todd Toys\", the name was changed in 1995 following pressure from Mattel, who feared that the new company's name would be confused with that of Barbie's younger brother. Production began with action figures based upon Todd McFarlane's Spawn comic series and has since grown to feature a large number of licensed property lines including The Simpsons and \"Movie Maniacs\" (which features numerous famous horror icons such as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, The Terminator, Leatherface, and The Thing), as well as other characters and lines like basketball, hockey and baseball legends, along with characters from video games such as Soulcalibur, Onimusha, and Metal Gear Solid. Other media such as story book characters from Where the Wild Things Are have been represented. The company has produced original works, giving a grotesque twist to fairy tale stories such as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and historical figures. McFarlane has collaborated with artists like Clive Barker (on Tortured Souls) and H. R. Giger to produce other original figures. The first line of Spawn toys ever produced was released in 1994 and consisted of six figures, the hero Spawn and his medieval counterpart (aptly named Medieval Spawn) with Tremor and the villains Violator, Overt-Kill, and Clown, as well as a Spawn Alley Playset, the Spawnmobile and the Violator Monster Rig. They were notably different from the toys common on shelves at the time because of their level of detail in both sculpting and painting. Other toys utilized only a few colors painted in general areas (a single \"flesh tone\" for the face, etc.) and were tacked to cardboard backs. McFarlane's figures had individual items such as spikes, teeth, claws, and buttons painted individually and packaged encased by hard plastic which surrounded both the figure and blister card, making them more suitable collectors items. Each toy in the first line came with a regular-sized comic (although with fewer pages than the standard 22), which were individualized to the character. The series would include alternate time periods and different takes on the classic characters with Series 10, 20 and 30 showing homage to the core characters of the books.[citation needed] Prototypes for Series 35 were revealed in 2008 but the series was cancelled before its release. Series 36 was also teased at SDCC 2008 but was also cancelled. Some of the teased series 36 figures were later released at statues. and was called \"Robot Wars\". It refers to a villainous \"Mechanoid Army\". McFarlane Toys has produced licensed figures based on various Japanese anime and manga properties. Series McFarlane have merchandised include Akira, Tenchi Muyo, Tokyo Ghoul, Attack on Titan and Naruto Shippuden. In 2019, it was announced that the company had also gained the rights to create figures based on One-Punch Man and My Hero Academia. McFarlane had been a long-time fan of the horror genre and decided to produce his own perspective on the classic monsters with the \"Todd McFarlane's Monsters Playsets\" line in 1997. McFarlane continued the idea of generating new versions of classic stories and characters, releasing a shocking line subtitled \"Twisted Land of Oz\" in 2003, which featured vicious or sadistic versions of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz characters created by L. Frank Baum. In 2004, the third series, subtitled 6 Faces of Madness, used historical killers and madmen as its theme, generating vividly detailed figurines of the 5th-century conqueror Attila the Hun, American \"Wild West\" gunslinger Billy the Kid, the \"mad monk\" Rasputin, the British serial killer Jack the Ripper, the Hungarian \"Blood Queen\" Elizabeth Bathory, and the real-life inspiration for Dracula, Vlad the Impaler. The fourth series featured Twisted Fairy Tales. The figures were of classic children’s stories, including Peter Pumpkin-Eater, Hansel & Gretel, Little Miss Muffet, Humpty Dumpty, & Red Riding Hood, and incorporated many of the gory elements that consumers had come to expect from McFarlane, but with a sense of ironic humor.[citation needed] Series 5 featured McFarlane's Twisted Christmas. Like the previous series, the figures all are twisted variations of Christmas, including a hunchback and obese Santa Claus who hides a lifeless skull under a gas mask-like headpiece and wears contraptions on his hands similar to the glove of Freddy Krueger. In 1998, McFarlane introduced the Movie Maniacs line of figures. Series One began as a line of horror and science fiction based figures that had been licensed from influential and financially successful horror films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th.[citation needed] The second series of figures expanded the character base for the line into the realms of cult and action cinema, with a figure based on the title character of The Crow. Series three would further push the boundaries of character selection into fantasy, with Edward Scissorhands, straight action with Shaft, and back into cult/sci-fi with Escape from L.A..[citation needed] These conventions would continue, with character selections in future series frequently containing a mix of many, or even all of these various film genres, much to the chagrin of a small section of fans and collectors who, incorrectly, saw the line as being meant to be horror specific. McFarlane Toys did not solely limit itself to creating figures based on Todd McFarlane's creations. Rather it branched out into other forms of media, capitalizing on the popularity of famous rock musicians with the release of figures based on the rock legends KISS in 1997. The number of music figures produced by the company continued to grow in number, diversity, and quality in the following years as they acquired the action figure rights to famous properties such as the Beatles, Rob Zombie, Alice Cooper, Ozzy Osbourne, Metallica, Slash, Iron Maiden's mascot Eddie, Jimi Hendrix, Freddie Mercury and Elvis Presley. In 1997, action figures were part of an overall marketing deal between McFarlane Toys and the rock band KISS, with both toys and comic books based on their album Psycho Circus. Release of new KISS products from McFarlane continues to the present day.[citation needed] The second musical property that McFarlane released was based on the Beatles, featuring figures of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr as they appeared in their 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine, as well as their appearance in the 1965 ABC cartoon show also titled The Beatles. Despite three figure series based on cartoon versions of the band (two incarnations of the Yellow Submarine figures in 1996 and 2004), no figures of the real-life band members have been created by McFarlane Toys. McFarlane Toys reflects Todd McFarlane's love of sports in its creations of popular figures from all five major North American sports (baseball, football, basketball, hockey and stock car racing). The company has official licensing rights to the major professional leagues of all of these sports, and began this line, officially known as McFarlane Sports Picks, in 2001. In January 2007, McFarlane Toys announced plans for a line of 24 action figures. Other series figures have included Lost and The Walking Dead. In 2015, McFarlane toys launched a line of construction sets based on HBO's popular Game of Thrones TV series, followed by a line of 6\" action figures to be released in 2019. The company also produces action figures based on the Netflix series Stranger Things. Released in September 2000, the figures were based on the characters of SCTV and Strange Brew fame, Bob and Doug McKenzie. Originally portrayed by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas, respectively. The figures were sold separately and each came with half of the diorama from the Great White North set. Each had a sound chip with famous lines from the film and various extras to complete the scene. In 2005, McFarlane acquired the rights held by rival manufacturer Playmates Toys to produce figures based on the popular Fox TV series The Simpsons. In 2017, McFarlane Toys inked a deal to produce action figures and role play items based on the popular Star Trek franchise. Controversy ensued when the company's Star Trek: Discovery phaser toy was cancelled just months before its scheduled release date. In a statement, McFarlane Toys said that the product was cancelled due to disagreements regarding the safety regulations around toy guns in the United States. The first action figures were released in early 2019, with James T. Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard serving as the inaugural entries in the line while the next figures Michael Burnham and Spock are in production.[citation needed] McFarlane Toys has produced a number of products based on video games, including Metal Gear Solid, Soulcalibur II (The Xbox version of which featured McFarlane's own Spawn as a guest character), Halo, Five Nights at Freddy's, Call of Duty, Destiny, Cuphead, Borderlands and Assassin's Creed. In 2018, McFarlane Toys launched a series of Fortnite action figures, which differed greatly from the company's previous figures (which were often statue-like and had very limited movement) by including at least 18 points of articulation each. The toys proved very popular, and Todd McFarlane later announced that the increased articulation scheme would become standard in the company's product from then on, including their upcoming line of Mortal Kombat 11 figures. At the tail end of 2018, news broke that Mattel had lost the rights to create figures based on the characters of the DC Universe to Spin Master Studios after 15 years of producing DC merchandise. In February 2019, it was announced that McFarlane Toys had secured the rights to create 6\"-12\" collector figures based on the various comic books, movies, cartoons, live-action TV shows and video games featuring DC's characters. Dubbed DC Multiverse, the line will be aimed at adult collectors, in contrast to the all-ages oriented DC toys produced by Spin Master. In a subsequent interview with IGN, Todd McFarlane confirmed that the new figures will target the same collectors who bought other 6\" superhero toy lines, such as Mattel's DC Universe Classics or Hasbro's Marvel Legends. He also revealed that the figures will use the new articulation system first seen in the company's Fortnite toys, meaning that they will all include between 18 and 24 points of articulation. McFarlane's Dragons are a line of action figures which were launched in 2005 under the \"Horror, Fantasy and Sci-Fi Action Figures\" section of McFarlane Toys. These figures were released biannually. This set features several highly detailed six inch dragon action figures and a slightly larger and more expansive \"boxed set\" figure. For the first five series, the figures were broken into these clans: Eternal Dragon Clan, Fire Dragon Clan, Komodo Dragon Clan, Sorcerer's Dragon Clan, Water Dragon Clan, and Berserker Clan. Series Six includes new clans: Fossil Dragon Clan, Hunter Dragon Clan, Ice Dragon Clan, Scavenger Dragon Clan, and Warrior Dragon Clan. In addition to these highly detailed dragons, McFarlane released a part of the dragon's history with each dragon set; some had a piece of the story with each dragon, and some had whole chunks of the story in one boxed set. The company launched a \"toy soldier\" range in 2005 with McFarlane's Military. The figures did not depict actual people so much as it did their professions, named simply by their job descriptions, such as \"Army Ranger\" or \"Navy SEAL.\" All were of stern-looking males in full military gear, with highly detailed weapons and accessories modeled after the exact materials each soldier would be carrying in real life. In 2000, McFarlane Toys produced figures based on Maurice Sendak's classic children's book Where the Wild Things Are. Figures include Max, Goatboy (packaged together), Moishe, Emil, Bernard, Aaron and Tzippy. Each character was sculpted with the same crosshatch style from Sendak's original illustrations.[citation needed] On July 27, 2021, McFarlane Toys announced that it would take over management of any remaining DC Direct inventory and that it would continue to make statues, busts, and other collectibles (such as action figures) in DC Direct's previous merchandise lines. The company anticipates releasing new products in 2022. A number of McFarlane's figures have attracted criticism and led to boycotts for the subject matter they depict, such as Death Row Marv, which depicts the central character from the graphic novel Sin City in the electric chair, which includes a toggle switch that allows the user to \"execute\" the character, who shakes and speaks as if being electrocuted when the switch is flipped. Others, such as the company's Austin Powers action figure, were criticized for risqué language in their sound chips and packaging. Mcfarlane Toys Headquarters on Quiddith.org Scott, Sharon M. (2010).
