# Embedding Directory

This directory contains the embedding vectors for the text sections and Question-Answer Sets (QAS), as well as the results of the matching process based on cosine similarity.

## Directory Structure

- **`qas/`**: Contains the embedding vectors for the Question-Answer Sets (QAS).
- **`text/`**: Contains the embedding vectors for the text sections.
- **`output/`**: Contains plots and statistics that summarize the matching results based on cosine similarity between the text and QAS embeddings.
