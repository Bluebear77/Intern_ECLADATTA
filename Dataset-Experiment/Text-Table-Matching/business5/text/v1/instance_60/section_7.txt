In 1986 Usinor and Sacilor were combined under one holding company headed by [[Francis Mer]].
The group accounted for 95% of French steel production.{{sfn|Godelier|2008|p=126}}
The Usinor-Sacilor group undertook an internal reorganization in 1987 into four specialized divisions: Sollac for thin flat products, Ugine for special flat and stainless steel products, Unimetal for long products and Ascometal for special long products.{{sfn|Mioche|1994|p=22}}
The new Sollac, the largest subsidiary of the group, included the flat products operations of the formerly competing Usinor and Sollac companies.{{sfn|Godelier|2008|p=127}}
In 1988 the company started to base profit sharing on productivity improvements, with the share calculated separately at each location.{{sfn|Daley|1996|p=165}}

In January 1993 Sollac decided to increase its prices to offset declining volumes.{{sfn|Mioche|1994|p=23}}
As of 2000 the Sollac steel plant just outside Dunkirk was one of the largest and most efficient in Europe.
It converted iron ore and coal into steel rolls in a continuous process, producing 6 million tonnes annually.
The plant had a dedicated port, railway and {{convert|55|km}} road network.
However, Sollac was struggling due to decline in demand from the automobile and construction industries in Europe, with prices falling and excess steel piling up.{{sfn|Bamford|Munday|2002|p=59}}

On 1 February 2000 Usinor was restructured geographically.
Sollac-Atlantique, Sollac-Lorraine and Sollac-Méditerranée were now fully independent subsidiaries. 
Sollac-Méditerranée included the French plants at Fos-sur-Mer and Saint-Chély-d'Apcher, and also included plants in Spain, Italy, Turkey and Portugal.{{sfn|Modernisation en vue pour Sollac – L'UsineNouvelle}}
In February 2002 Usinor was merged with Arbed (Luxembourg) and Aceralia (Spain) to form Arcelor.{{sfn|Our History – ArcelorMittal}}
In 2006 Arcelor was merged with Mittal Steel to form [[ArcelorMittal]].{{sfn|Our History – ArcelorMittal}}
Sollac Atlantique was terminated on 22 January 2007.{{sfn|Sollac Atlantique – Societe SAS}}
As of 2008 the subsidiaries were named Société Arcelor Atlantique et Lorraine and Sollac Méditerrannée.
The companies were involved in a dispute with the French government over the [[greenhouse gas emissions|greenhouse gas emission]] allowance trading scheme, in which different treatment was being applied to the steel sector and to the chemical and non-ferrous metal sectors.{{sfn|EUR-Lex - 62007CA0127 - EN}}

Sollac Mediterranee was later renamed ArcelorMittal Mediterranee SASU.{{sfn|ArcelorMittal Mediterranee SASU ... Bloomberg}}
In 2017 ArcelorMittal Atlantique et Lorraine included the main plant at Dunkirk with a capacity of 7 million tonnes of steel slab and 4.45 million tonnes of hot-rolled coils per year.
It also supplied steel slabs to the second hot rolling mill of the unit located in Sérémange in Lorraine.
The unit also included plants at Florange, Base-Indre, Desvres, Mardyck, Montataire and Mouzon.
In 2012 49% of the unit's output was delivered to the automobile sector.{{sfn|Atlantique et Lorraine – ArcelorMittal}}
