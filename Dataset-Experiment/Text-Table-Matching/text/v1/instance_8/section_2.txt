Title: History

Value:
Ponant started out with one ship, [[Le Ponant]], a three masted Barque built in 1991. Le Ponant still operates with the company today. Eight years later in 1999, the company acquired Le Levant, a yacht. After 13 years in service with Ponant, Le Levant was purchased by [[Paul Gauguin Cruises]] in 2012 and became [[MV Tere Moana|Tere Moana]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cruise-community.com/News/News-Headlines/Paul-Gauguin-buys-Le-Levant-to-branch-out-from-South-Pacific.html |title=Paul Gauguin buys Le Levant, to branch out from South Pacific |publisher=Cruise-community.com |date=September 30, 2011 |access-date=October 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005164342/http://www.cruise-community.com/News/News-Headlines/Paul-Gauguin-buys-Le-Levant-to-branch-out-from-South-Pacific.html |archive-date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref> In 2004, Ponant purchased Le Diamant, a luxury liner. Le Diamant transferred to [[Quark Expeditions]] in 2012 to become [[Ocean Diamond]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Kevin|title=Ocean Diamond Joins Quark Expeditions|url=http://www.latecruisenews.com/2011/12/12/norwegian-announces-its-2013-program-other-cruise-news-queen-mary-2-under-bermudian-flag-ocean-diamond-joins-quark-expeditions-princess-cuts-new-york-bermuda-program-to-two-cruises/|work=Cybercruises.com|access-date=8 February 2012|date=12 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107024111/http://www.latecruisenews.com/2011/12/12/norwegian-announces-its-2013-program-other-cruise-news-queen-mary-2-under-bermudian-flag-ocean-diamond-joins-quark-expeditions-princess-cuts-new-york-bermuda-program-to-two-cruises/|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Later, in 2010, Ponant put into service the first of a series of four identical luxury sister ships, [[Le Boreal]]. A year later, the company began operating the second ship of the class, [[L'Austral]] and in 2013 the third ship of the class was added to the fleet, [[Le Soléal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=L'Austral|publisher=Cruise Line|access-date=24 December 2013|url=http://www.cruiseline.co.uk/L-Austral}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ponant's Le Soléal Enters Service with Godmother Kiki Tauck Mahar as Guest of Honor|publisher=Travel Pulse|access-date=24 December 2013|url=http://www.travelpulse.com/news/cruise/kiki-tauck-mahar-ponants-le-solal-enters-service-with-godmother.html}}</ref> The fourth ship of the class, [[Le Lyrial]], was delivered in 2015.

Initially based in [[Nantes]] for 18 years, in 2006 the company headquarters was moved to [[Marseille]] following its acquisition by [[CMA CGM]]. In 2012, CMA CGM sold Ponant to [[Bridgepoint Capital]].<ref> Bridgepoint Acquires Ponant</ref>

On April 4, 2008, Le Ponant was seized by [[Somali people|Somali]] [[pirate]]s in the [[Gulf of Aden]] while en route from the [[Seychelles]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. The ship carried no passengers at the time of its capture, but all 30 crewmembers were taken hostage.<ref>{{cite news|title=Somali pirates seize French yacht|date=4 April 2008|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7331290.stm}}</ref> The hostages were released without incident on April 12. Following the release, French [[helicopters]] tracked the pirates  to the village of [[Jariban]]. French [[Naval commandos (France)|commando marine]] and [[GIGN]] operating from the frigate [[Jean Bart (D 615)|Jean Bart]] and the [[Jeanne d'Arc (R 97)|Jeanne d'Arc]] moved in when the pirates attempted to flee in the desert. A sniper disabled the get-away vehicle, and the commandos were able to capture six men. Local officials claimed that three people died in the raid, with a further eight wounded, but France denied this. Troops also recovered some of the [[ransom]] money paid by the owner of the yacht for the release of its crew.<ref>{{cite news|title=France raid ship after crew freed|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=12 April 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7342292.stm}}</ref> The six captured pirates have since been flown to Paris, where they shall face trial.<ref>{{cite news|title=France charges Somali 'pirates'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=18 April 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7355598.stm}}</ref>

In 2012, the owner of Compagnie du Ponant, CMA CGM, sold the company to [[Bridgepoint Capital]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2012/07/03/20005-20120703ARTFIG00696-l-armateur-cma-cgm-cede-la-compagnie-du-ponant.php|title=L'armateur CMA CGM cède la Compagnie du Ponant|website=Lefigaro.fr|date=3 July 2012|author=Charles Gautier|language=fr|access-date=19 May 2019}}</ref>

In 2013, one of Ponant's ships, Le Soleal, became the first French commercial shipping vessel to traverse the [[Northwest Passage]]. The vessel left [[Kangerlussuaq]] in [[Greenland]] on August 26, 2013, and arrived in [[Anadyr (town)|Anadyr]], in [[Russia]] on September 16, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ponant ship makes history |url=http://www.sixstarcruises.co.uk/blog/compagnie-du-ponant-ship-makes-history/|publisher=SixStarCruises|access-date=15 December 2013}}</ref>

In 2015, [[Groupe Artémis]] bought Compagnie du Ponant from Bridgepoint.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lepoint.fr/art-de-vivre/la-compagnie-du-ponant-embarque-chez-artemis-27-07-2015-1952812_4.php|title=La compagnie du Ponant embarque chez Artémis|website=Lepoint.fr|date=27 July 2015|access-date=19 May 2019}}</ref>

In March 2016, Ponant ordered four new ships with about 10,000 [[Gross tonnage|GT]] at Vard, a subcompany of [[Fincantieri]].<ref name="For new ships">{{cite web|url=https://www.fincantieri.it/cms/data/browse/news/000722.aspx|title=VARD: 4 NAVI DA CROCIERA PER PONANT|date=2016-03-15|access-date=2016-03-15}}</ref> They were delivered in 2018 and 2019. The ships are named [[Le Lapérouse]], [[Le Champlain]], [[Le Bougainville]] and [[Le Dumont-d'Urville]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ponant.com/new-ships|title=4 NOUVEAUX NAVIRES POUR PONANT|access-date=2016-09-15}}</ref>

In December 2017, Le Lapérouse left Vard Tulcea in Romania and was heading to final outfitting at Vard facility in Norway.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/18364-le-laperouse-heading-to-norway-from-tulcea.html|title=Le Lapérouse Heading to Norway from Tulcea|last=Staff|first=CIN|date=2017-12-28|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> She arrived in mid of January.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.meretmarine.com/fr/content/ponant-la-coque-du-laperouse-est-arrivee-en-norvege|title=Ponant : La coque du Lapérouse est arrivée en Norvège|date=23 January 2018}}</ref>

In December 2017, Ponant announced that it had ordered an [[icebreaker|icebreaking]] expedition cruise ship from Vard. The {{NOK|2.7 billion|link=yes}} (about €274 million) vessel will be built to the second-highest [[International Association of Classification Societies|IACS]] [[ice class]], [[Polar Class 2]], and will be capable of taking tourists to the [[North Pole]]. The vessel, named [[Le Commandant Charcot]], is scheduled for delivery in 2021.<ref>Next destination North Pole.

In March 2018, Ponant announced the order of two additional 180-passenger expedition ships, Le Bellot and Le Jaques Cartier; they joined the company in 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/18663-ponant-orders-two-more-expedition-vessels.html|title=Ponant Orders Two More Expedition Vessels|last=Staff|first=CIN|date=2018-03-06|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In 2019 Ponant purchased [[Paul Gauguin Cruises]] owners of the [[Paul Gauguin (ship)|Paul Gauguin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/21353-ponant-purchases-paul-gauguin.html|title=Ponant Purchases Paul Gauguin|date=8 August 2019}}</ref>

In 2020 Ponant came under criticism for refusing to provide refunds to passengers from cancelled cruises due to [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://boards.cruisecritic.com/topic/2740662-need-a-fair-refund-policy-due-to-virus/ | title=Need a Fair Refund Policy Due to Virus }}</ref> During the pandemic, the ship did not sail for some time but resumed operations on 18 July 2020 for local residents and on 29 July for international guests, with reduced occupancy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news/covid-19-case-paul-gauguin-french-polynesia|title=COVID-19 case on Paul Gauguin in French Polynesia|date=2 August 2020 |publisher=Sea Trade|access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref>

A news report on 3 August 2020 stated that the COVID-19 virus had been detected on the MS Paul Gauguin while it was in [[Papeete, Tahiti]]; passengers were required to stay in their cabins.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/03/two-cruise-ships-hit-by-coronavirus-weeks-after-industry-restarts|title=Two cruise ships hit by coronavirus weeks after industry restarts|date=3 August 2020 |work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref> At that time, after renovations, the capacity was stated to be 318 guests plus a crew of 216. The ship had been modified to use a "cleaner" fuel: LS MGO – Low-Sulphur Marine Gas Oil and the company planned "to offset 150 percent of its carbon emissions".<ref>m/s Paul Gauguin Renovations</ref>

In spring 2020, Le Commandant Charcot was being built by Vard, Fincantieri shipbuilding subsidiary in Norway. This high polar exploration ship is equipped with a hybrid propulsion system which uses both electricity and liquefied natural gas (LNG).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/25597-ponant-takes-delivery-of-le-commandant-charcot-from-fincantieri-s-vard.html | title=Ponant Takes Delivery of le Commandant Charcot from Fincantieri's VARD | date=2 August 2021 }}</ref> Delivered in August 2021<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.luxurytraveladvisor.com/cruises/ponant-takes-delivery-le-commandant-charcot | title=Ponant Takes Delivery of le Commandant Charcot | date=5 August 2021 }}</ref> Le Commandant Charcot has a similar design to the PONANT Explorer series, though she is larger and more powerful. Due to the manoeuvrability of the [[Azimuth thruster|Azipod systems]], she can operate both in ahead direction and sternfirst, depending on the prevailing ice conditions. Le Commandant Charcot is also the first ship to feature a Polar Class 2 icebreaking hull.

On March 29, 2021, following the announcement of François-Henri Pinault, Managing Partner of Artémis, Hervé Gastinel took over after Jean-Emmanuel Sauvée as the company's CEO.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.travelweekly.com.au/article/ponant-names-new-ceo/ | title=Ponant names new CEO }}</ref>
