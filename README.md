# Dataset-Experiment: Internship Results

This directory documents the results of an internship as part of the ECLADATTA project, which aims to improve the extraction and interpretation of latent knowledge from documents by analyzing both texts and tables.

## Background

**ECLADATTA** (ExtraCtion of LAtent knowledge in Documents by conjointly Analyzing Texts and TAbles) is a project that explores the complementary nature of tables and text within or across documents. By leveraging both sources of information, the project aims to enhance data interpretation, quality assessment, and metadata enrichment, thereby boosting semantic services such as dataset indexing, question-answering systems, and knowledge base development.

## Contributions

- **Benchmark Analysis**: We conducted an in-depth analysis of publicly available benchmark datasets for reasoning over tables, emphasizing their interrelations and contributions to LLM training.
- **Corpus Construction**: We constructed and studied three topic-specific corpora (female celebrities, business, telco) consisting of text and tables, pre-processed in English and French.
- **ReasTAP Application**: We applied the ReasTAP model to generate a question-answer pairs (QAS) corpus that requires reasoning for the three created corpora.
- **Text-Table Relatedness Evaluation**: We evaluated the relatedness between textual sections and tables within the same Wikipedia page, using cosine similarity of SBERT embeddings between generated QAS and text data.

## Directory Structure

### 1. **7-Benchmark-Dataset**
   - **Description**: Contains a comprehensive study of seven benchmark datasets, focusing on their interrelations and their role in training large language models (LLMs).
   - **Datasets**: Includes ToTTo, LOGICNLG, QTSumm, LOTNLG, FetaQA, WTQ, and F2WTQ.

### 2. **ECLADATTA-3-Corpus**
   - **Description**: Contains three corpora constructed for the ECLADATTA project, focusing on business, telco, and female celebrities. Each corpus is processed and structured for input into the ReasTAP model.
   - **Subdirectories**:
     - **100-female-celebrities/**: Pre-processing pipeline for the 100 Female Celebrities dataset.
     - **business-100/**: Pre-processing pipeline for the 100 Business Instances dataset.
     - **telco-100/**: Pre-processing pipeline for the 100 Telecommunication Instances dataset.
     - **csv/**: Contains URL summarization CSV files for the three corpora.
     - **origin-files/**: Original, unprocessed files used as input.
     - **unparsed-template/**: Records of unparsed templates encountered during CorpusWalker parsing of wikitables.

### 3. **ReasTAP**
   - **Description**: Contains the results of the ReasTAP experiment conducted on the three ECLADATTA corpora, including the generated QAS corpus.

### 4. **Text-Table-Matching**
   - **Description**: Contains scripts and data for evaluating the similarity between textual paragraphs and tables through generated Question-Answer (QA) pairs. This involves text extraction, cleaning, embedding creation, and similarity calculation.

### 5. **URL-Comparison**
   - **Description**: Contains scripts and files for processing, analyzing, and visualizing URL data from the seven benchmark datasets and the three ECLADATTA corpora.

### 6. **ECLADATTA CorpusWalker.md**
   - **Description**: A quick start guide for using the ECLADATTA CorpusWalker tool, which aids in the extraction and processing of tables and text from documents.

### 7. **stas.py**
   - **Description**: A script that counts the number of files in specific subdirectories ("Complete," "Missing," "NoTable," and "Raw") within the "business-100" and "telco-100" directories, generating a `stats.md` file summarizing the file counts.

### 8. **stats.md**
   - **Description**: A markdown-formatted summary of the file counts for each subdirectory under the "business-100" and "telco-100" directories, generated by the `stas.py` script.

## Purpose

This directory serves as a comprehensive record of the internship's contributions to the ECLADATTA project, providing resources, scripts, and datasets that enhance the understanding and processing of text and tables in documents. It is intended as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners involved in related fields.
